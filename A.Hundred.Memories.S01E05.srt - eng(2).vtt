(A Hundred Memories)

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.410
You know how there are those days, Yeong Rye?

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.380
You wake up in the morning,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.990
and your favorite song "Red Dragonfly" by Cho Yong Pil...

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.860
is playing on the radio.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.259
This pickled lettuce is delicious, right?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.370
This is my favorite.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.769
- Yes. - Then you go to the cafeteria,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.840
and they serve that pickled lettuce you'd die for as a side dish.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.820
You find a pay phone with a bunch of change left in it.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.400
The sun is shining.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.400
There's a nice breeze,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.800
and you can't help but hum a tune.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.440
A day where you feel like everything's going your way.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.650
Seo Jong Hee?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.330
- What? - Where is she going?

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.710
She just ran away.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.189
My gosh.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.289
I'm so sorry.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.820
- Gosh. That hurts. - Are you okay?

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.820
I'm so sorry.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.450
That day was exactly one of those days.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.920
I should've known when I was having such good luck all morning.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.230
Why did I run away when I saw him?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.560
"Right. I'm a bus conductor."

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.000
That's what I was going to tell him when we met.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.370
I should have just told him confidently.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.340
But now that I've bolted like that, I'm just...

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.010
nothing but a liar.

(Episode 5: A Bad Day)

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.830
Hey, Driver! When are you ever going to leave?

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.469
Come on, I'm running late for work!

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.840
Let's go, already!

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.769
Believe me, I want to go too.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.679
But I can't leave without the conductor.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.539
How am I supposed to drive and work the doors all by myself?

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.110
I can't be in two places at once.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.020
The conductor is here.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.480
Oh, Ms. Koh!

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.150
Hurry up and get on.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.320
Go on, watch your step.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.630
- Hey. - We're leaving!

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.630
All clear!

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.530
Koh Yeong Rye?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.510
What?

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.480
Does this make any sense at all?

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.350
A bus conductor abandoning her bus mid-route,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.379
and a soldier abandoning his gun in wartime.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.449
How are they different?

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.920
In all my years...

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.619
In my 20 years at this company, I've never seen such a thing.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.219
In my ten years as a housemother,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.290
- this is the first time... - Will you just be quiet?

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.130
I...

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.100
am not letting this slide.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.660
- Ever! - That's right.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.530
But, sir, I...

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.099
still finished the route without any trouble.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.799
Without any trouble, as if!

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.270
Don't you know that on a bus route, time is money?

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.809
I mean, to be blunt, what if that girl, Seo Jong Hee...

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.280
had run off with the cash box? What would you have done then?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.210
Would you have taken responsibility for it?

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.749
Would you have taken the blame?

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.379
That's not what happened.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.419
I can't tell you why, but...

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.849
- I had no choice... - "No choice?"

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.220
There she is.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.590
I'm sorry.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.490
I won't take my pay for today.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.590
So please, leave her out of this.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.669
The nerve of her...

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.669
- Get back here! - Sir.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.109
Thanks for the bike. I'm sorry!

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.809
Think you can get away with anything just by being polite?

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.709
- Hey! - Is that it, Koh Yeong Rye?

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.750
Koh Yeong Rye!

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.300
Are you okay?

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.839
I was trying to give you your hat.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.070
I chased after you on a bike and...

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.310
I saw you with Han Jae Pil.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.250
I'm not okay.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.920
I regret it,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.690
and I'm so embarrassed.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.620
I hate myself,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.690
and I hate this horrid situation.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.470
But you know what the worst part is?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.340
I have to go to work right now.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.140
The schedule today is killer.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.730
There's something I need to tell you in person first.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.230
No, it's not something I can say over the phone.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.799
Hey, Jae Pil!

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.600
You won't believe what I just saw.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.570
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.670
Punch me. Go on, punch me.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.710
That hurts.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.350
Hey, Yeong Rye...

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.980
Yeong Rye.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.050
She's a bus conductor.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.750
What's with that reaction?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.530
Don't tell me you knew all along.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.000
Then, is Seo Jong Hee too?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.750
Cheers.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.290
This booze tastes especially good tonight.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.860
Hey, now.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.600
My mom said pouring your own drink is three years of bad luck.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.270
As if my luck could get any worse.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.280
I feel so trapped.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.020
I wish I could see the sea tonight. It would clear my head.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.220
Hey.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.690
Should we go right now? To the sea at Incheon?

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.260
- Right now? - Yes.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.790
How would we get there?

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.090
Take a taxi?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.129
The fare would be expensive, right?

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.159
Yes.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.630
We'd probably have to blow our entire day's pay.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.140
I guess this booze will have to do for tonight.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.280
Yeong Rye.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.190
Why is my life like this?

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.660
Life seems even more bitter than this soju.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.700
But still...

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.840
This soju's aftertaste...

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.910
is pretty sweet.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.540
You know why?

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.819
Because soju is a diluted spirit,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.689
they add artificial sweeteners to it like it's some kind of seasoning.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.660
Which means the soju itself is actually incredibly bitter.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.030
I see.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.800
Thanks for that fun fact.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.140
That's a real comfort.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.550
Here you go.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:50.450
Weren't you planning on telling Han Jae Pil anyway?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.820
I know.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.260
But letting him know myself and getting caught is different.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.600
It only takes a second to look like a complete fool.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.200
Right, Yeong Rye?

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.640
Hey.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.880
Drink with me.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.450
You're going to get wasted at this rate, you know?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.550
All right, cheers.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.289
Cheers!

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.289
Drumroll!

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.459
And Miss Korea is Seo Jong Hee!

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.299
Hey, you'll wake them up!

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.630
You're going to wake them up.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.170
Hold on.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.270
The winner needs a crown.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.339
- Gosh. What's that? - Here it is.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.740
All right.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.420
Beautiful.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.300
Hey.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.499
- Honestly. - Jong Hee.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.570
What?

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.670
You gorgeous thing.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.139
You have such a pretty face...

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.580
and an amazing body to match.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.650
But you know what?

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.090
The most beautiful thing about you is your heart.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.650
You really have it all, Seo Jong Hee.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.130
Just go to sleep.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.960
You have to be happy.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.470
- Yes, ma'am. - Okay?

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.300
You should be the one getting some sleep.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.580
If you're not happy,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.750
you'll have me to answer to.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.470
I wish I could be.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.560
(Incheon Milk)

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.179
Here you go, Sae Ri.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.950
What's the occasion for the ginseng chicken soup?

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.720
What do you mean? It's to help you regain your energy.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.950
You don't even use a space heater, let alone the furnace.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.590
I don't know what I see in you, honestly.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.690
And I lost sleep over it, I swear.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.400
Why did you lose sleep?

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.900
"Why..."

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.669
"Why did you lose sleep?"

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.100
Never mind. Forget I said anything.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.309
- Where's Jae Pil? - Let him be.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.539
He was up jumping rope late last night,

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.010
So he's definitely sleeping in.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.680
Why would he be jumping rope late at night?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.450
He should be hitting the books.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.709
Hurry up and go wake him!

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.780
We should all eat together on the weekend.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.289
That's what families do, right?

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.459
I still feel awkward waking Jae Pil up.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.290
What's so uncomfortable about it? We've been a family for ages.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.890
Hurry! Go wake him up!

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.860
Goodness.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.370
You could go yourself.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.740
My dear Sae Ri.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.809
Should Daddy pick out the meat for you?

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.010
- Right. - Yes.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.950
Jae Pil, breakfast is ready.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.620
Dad wants us all to eat together.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.730
Jae Pil?

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.190
Han Jae Pil.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.270
Jae Pil, I'm coming in, okay?

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.500
Jae Pil?

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.140
Where did he go?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.130
My word.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.370
I was wondering why the sun was shining so bright today.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.940
Reckon it was because of that sight over there.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.470
Oh, please.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.870
You go crazy every time you see a guy.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.950
Well, I'll admit. His back is a little incredible.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.120
Aren't "a little" and "incredible" kind of opposites?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.380
Be quiet.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.159
Excuse me.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.689
Are you looking for your girlfriend by any chance?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.490
We can go get her for you.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.770
Han Jae Pil?

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.020
(1pm in front of Vivaldi, Jae Pil)

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.330
Jong Hee!

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:40.800
Yes?

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.670
Outside! Right now.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.040
So...

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.940
Oh, my goodness!

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.870
This dashing man came looking for Yeong Rye.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.310
- A man? - Yes.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.349
I don't know what's going on between those two,

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.980
but they're having a hushed talk.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.690
You know the type.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.890
He's got this classy, pretty-boy face,

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.160
but his arms are all solid muscle.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.589
I mean,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.230
Can you believe that a guy like that actually exists?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.300
Jong Hee.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.270
Han Jae Pil...

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.100
is waiting for you outside.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.080
He wants to talk to you.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.090
(Bus Conductor Dormitory)

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.030
What's this about?

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.340
It doesn't matter to me.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.670
Whoever you are, a student or not, it...

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.440
- It doesn't matter to me. - It does for me.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.180
So...

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.380
Don't come looking for me again.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.850
You make me uncomfortable.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.780
Then why?

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.460
Why did you call me?

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.760
Why'd you ask to meet?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.140
To tell you this.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.740
That I'm not that into you.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.630
Look.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.900
Well...

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.170
I...

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.240
We didn't mean to lie from the beginning.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.310
Jong Hee and I.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.649
We go to Hwaran Night School, but...

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.320
We're friends with Ju Gyeong, the one who set up the group date.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.120
And she asked if we could fill in.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520
She asked us as a favor,

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.220
and that's why we went.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.530
I just...

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.630
felt I should explain how everything happened.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.300
Is your mom okay?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.470
What?

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.710
Yes.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.139
That's a relief.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.380
Thanks for telling me.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.490
The name is Seo Jong Yeon.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.960
Someone said they saw her working as a bus conductor around here.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.530
Please take a good look.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.869
It's an old photo, but...

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.100
a person's face doesn't change much in just a few years.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.640
I've looked and looked, but I don't recognize her.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.550
Are you sure she doesn't work here?

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.580
Yes, well...

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.320
She doesn't seem to be one of our bus conductors.

(Cheongah Bus, Ilpu Bus)

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.739
Another dead end?

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.679
Was that punk even sure he saw her?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.680
- Was he seeing things? - How should I know?

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.519
He said it looked like Jong Yeon at the time.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.619
But he might've still been drunk and seen it wrong.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.690
You punk.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.519
So was it her or not?

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.320
How would I know?

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.659
Just give up already.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.100
How many days have you spent searching every bus company?

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.300
Besides, you...

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.200
should take care of yourself.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.070
You punk. Are you being serious?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.440
If you're just going to rain on my parade, get lost. Okay?

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.010
I'll tear this whole country apart to find that wench.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.919
Hey, fine, I'll get lost, but let's grab a bite first.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.050
I'm hungry.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.620
Hey.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.290
That actor is so handsome.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.160
Should I leave Clark Gable for him?

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.000
How can he be so chiseled?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.399

I'd love to ride a horse, too.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.680
You can learn to ride when you're older.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.320
Or just get your driver's license and start with a car first.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.949
Why?

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.520
But they said Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi ride horses all the time.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.120
Who?

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.260

Yes.

Oh, my.

Mr. Koh's mother runs this place?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.780
Well, it's a horse, alright.

My goodness.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.169
Right. I completely forgot.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.010
I should have paid you first.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.180
How much is it?

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.680
It's 6 cents for 5 minutes, and 10 cents for 10 minutes.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.850
That's all? Gosh, that's so cheap.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.450
Here you go.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.880
For crying out loud.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.720
For a kids' ride, who pays with a one-dollar bill?

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.490
Some people have more money than sense.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.030
Excuse me.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.959
I haven't even officially opened yet,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.899
so I don't have any change. What do you expect me to do?

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.899
Well, in that case...

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.269
Then I'll try this.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.399
So I just have to carve it out like this, right?

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.500

Failed again. Gosh.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.649
This is...

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.620
a lot harder than it looks.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.190
Goodness.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.160
- Try this one. - Thanks.

If it were that easy, how could I make a living at this?

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.230
To you, it's probably a date seed stuck in your nostril,

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.139
but this is what I used to feed, clothe, and raise my four kids.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.200
Oh, my.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.340
Oh, my. Why would a date seed get stuck in your nostril?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.410
This lady is hilarious.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.820
A date seed in your nostril.

Sae Ri, are you having fun?

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.220
Yes, it's so much fun!

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.530
By the way, Yeong Bae, you're a really good rider.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.299
Gosh. You're so high up!

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.600
You look so cool, Yeong Bae!

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.430
You think he is cool?

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.939
Then, Sae Ri, are you going to marry him?

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.210
Because he's cool.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.140
No, I'm going to marry Yeong Sik.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.249
Yeong Sik is way cooler.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.310
That is true.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.150
He's like a prince on a white horse.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.359
- Hey, block him! - Get him.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.390
- Block him. - Here!

00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.760
Hey.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.170
I never knew I was such a snob.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.040
Yeong Rye.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.500
No, wait. Is she older than me?

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.170
Well, anyway.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.740
My feelings for Yeong Rye...

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.680
I thought they were as pure as the driven snow.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.620
But then again, nothing melts faster than snow.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.250
Hey, that's not the point here, man.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.390
Anyway...

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.760
I'm really torn.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.160
As you know, I'm an only child.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.800
And my parents are bound to be against it.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.670
But I don't want to see her get hurt either.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.340
Hey.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.270
Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.370
Hey, you never know what can happen.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.980
Anyway, to give up or go for it, that is the question.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.480
I mean, I really do like Yeong Rye, right?

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.649
Go for it? Or don't?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.489
Go for it? Or don't?

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:00.320
Go for it? Or don't?

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.290
Go! Okay!

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.760
Let's do this.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.760
After all, the person I like is Ko Yeong Rye herself.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.900
Go big or go home! I'm going for it!

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.320
Hey, miss.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.530
Me?

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.570
Let me ask you one thing.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.610
Is there a bus conductor named Seo Jong Yeon here?

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.340
I'm not sure.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.740
I don't think I've heard that name before.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.580
This is her mug. Are you sure she's not here?

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.590
I don't think I've seen her.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.500
Are you sure?

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.200
Open your eyes and take a good look.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.930
I know...

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.170
every conductor who works here.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.240
If I say she's not here, she's not here.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.310
Darn it.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.320
Where'd that little rat scurry off to?

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.570
What? What is it?

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.510
- Just now... - Yes?

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.650
A strange man...

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.050
came looking for you.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.850
"A strange man?"

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:13.020
He said he was looking for someone called Seo Jong Yeon,

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.260
so I told him I didn't know anyone by that name.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.160
But then he showed me your photo and asked if I was sure.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.400
I got a really bad feeling, so I insisted I didn't know you.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.900
But it was definitely you.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.780
What's going on, Jong Hee?

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.550
Jong Hee!

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.589
What's wrong, Jong Hee? What is it?

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.460
What is it?

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.860
I have to run.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.330
As fast as I can.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.400
Just try to calm down, Jong Hee.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.000
What is it? Who was that guy?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.000
The most vicious punk in the world.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.170
My brother.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.710
Your brother?

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.950
Hold on.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.750
So where are you going to run to?

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.680
Do you even have a place to go?

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.450
Did you even figure out where to go before you started packing?

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.260
You know what they say, haste makes waste.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.970
First, let's call in sick to work.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.770
And then what?

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.510
Well?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.580
You have to disappear.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.480
Without a trace.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.650
Completely.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.030
Mom.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.330
Please don't ask any questions.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.199
Just let me stay at your place for a few days.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.500
Please? Mom?

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.440
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.710
I'll explain everything when the time is right.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.540
I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.320
Mom.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.890
It's hard enough feeding my family. How can I take in someone else?

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.460
Mom.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.590
You're about to make kimchi.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.529
Gosh. That's going to be so good.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.799
Jong Hee, when you try the kimchi my mom makes,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.499
it'll blow your mind. I'm not kidding.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.499
With this fresh kimchi salad and fresh mudflat oysters...

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.169
Gosh. It's out of this world.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.869
Mom, after we salt these, can Jong Hee and I dig for oysters?

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.440
Hey, these have already been salted and drained.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.450
If you want to turn this kimchi into a salt lick,

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.980
go on, soak it in there again.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.820
I thought you hadn't done it yet.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.460
You're going to earn your keep, right?

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.030
I'm not about to feed someone who just sits around.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.170
If you think you'll just sit around and be served, then you can go.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.970
Wait. Mom?

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.310
Mom, does that mean Jong Hee can really stay with us? Really?

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.579
- Thank you, Mom! - Come on, you're getting me wet.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.879
Goodness, this girl.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.480
Goodness, why are you being so clingy?

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.849
- Oh, Mom. - Thank you so much, ma'am.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.750
I'll take good care of Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.390
- Yes! - Why is Mom...

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.189
- I'm home! - You're back?

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.490
Yeong Sik, Jong Hee is going to live with us starting today!

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.799
Hey, go on into the room and unpack your things. Hurry up.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.529
- Let's go! - Thank you.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.530
Let's go.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200
Come to the kitchen.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.090
Mokpo Lady was saying...

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.630
you have to drink this to keep your mind sharp.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:10.730
Drink this.

00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:11.760
Okay.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.759
Drink it now.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.469
Drink it now while those rascals are distracted.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.170
If they see it, they'll snatch it away.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.170
- Hurry. - I'll drink it later.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.410
So, what's going on with Yeong Rye's friend?

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.340
I don't know. She showed up pale as a ghost.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.110
And she told me not to ask what's going on, of all things.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.580
She didn't seem like a troublemaker, so I let her stay for a few days.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.689
Make sure you drink this. Don't forget.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.750
I got it.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.220
And don't give any to Yeong Bae or Yeong Mi.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.210
Drink it.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.440
I warmed it up, so it'll help you sleep.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.280
Thanks.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.750
You know, I have a feeling...

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.390
your mother meant for this to be just for you.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.460
You catch on quick.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.560
I'd better drink it fast then.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.690
If your mom finds out, I'll get kicked out for sure.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.910
I might be overstepping, but...

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.310
I don't know what you're going through,

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.680
but just running and hiding isn't the answer.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.350
To get past something...

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.390
is to actually go through it.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.990
That is, if you really want to be done with it.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.400
You're right.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.839
You're right, but...

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.440
But you know how it is.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.880
Like when you're at school, waiting to get a shot,

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.639
and even though you know you have to get it,

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.150
you keep moving to the back of the line.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.780
I guess that's what happens when you're too scared.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.990
People can be so foolish.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.360
People are inherently foolish.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.100
Especially me.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.700
I act all tough,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.040
but I'm actually a huge coward.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.870
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.440
I already have the rice cooking. I'll set the table after this.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.140
My goodness, when did you wake up to get all this done?

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.780
Oh, my goodness. You even swept the yard?

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.819
You're leaving already, without breakfast?

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.050
Yes, I have a class.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.690
I'm heading out.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:32.790
Oh, my gosh!

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:36.790
Oh, no.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.030
Goodness! What's wrong with you?

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.900
- Are you hurt? - Oh, no. What do I do?

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.140
That's it.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.610
You're old enough to start washing your own shoes now, okay?

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.340
- Okay. - That's it.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.010
Gosh. Yeong Mi, you're really good at this!

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.780
Way to go, Yeong Bae! That's it!

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.690
Yeong Sik.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.400
Wear these.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.940
Kids, I'm home!

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.280
- Yeong Rye! - And I brought dumplings!

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.080
Dumplings!

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.819
- Make sure you share, okay? - You bought dumplings?

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.820
Okay.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.650
It smells delicious.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.530
Blow on them first. They're hot.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.860
You must be tired.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.140
I took sick leave so suddenly. The dispatch schedule must be chaos.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.810
No, don't worry about it.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.080
Compared to you covering for me when my mom was sick,

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.640
this is nothing.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.850
Still...

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.979
The personnel manager must be fuming,

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.480
and the housemother too.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.960
You know, Yeong Rye, I've been thinking.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.200
I think I might just go back to work today.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.070
Already?

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.610
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.240
Well, that punk...

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.640
has probably given up and left the neighborhood by now.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.020
Besides, it's not like I can keep hiding forever.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.650
I might as well just face him.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.890
It's not like he'll kill me.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.200
I'm just going to go now.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.530
Okay.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.000
- Hello. - Hello.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.970
I can't remember the last time we had a day off.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.149
The schedule's been so packed. It's been absolutely brutal.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.479
Tell me about it.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.920
The schedule was already killing us, then that wench takes sick leave.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.920
But why'd she suddenly take sick leave anyway?

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.689
She didn't even look that sick.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.590
I don't know. I doubt she was actually sick.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.190
She's a bit melancholic.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.000
She's impossible to figure out.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.800
Hae Ja.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.999
Don't you mean "mysterious," not "melancholic?"

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.170
Whatever!

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.440
It's obvious she ran with a rough crowd.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.440
Who knows what she did before she washed up here.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.979
She's obviously hiding something.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.410
That's why she skipped out, pretending to be sick.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.590
- That's correct, right? - Yes.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.519
- Thank you. - Have a good one.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.730
Bye now.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.050
- How's it going over there? - It's good!

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.250
Gosh. Jong Hee!

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.690
- Jong Hee! - Have you been okay?

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.190
Are you feeling better now?

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.659
You were sick, not on vacation. I was worried sick about you.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.730
I'm fine.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.630
I put you all through a lot, didn't I?

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.730
Let's go inside. I brought us some treats!

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.339
Hold on a second.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.610
- I'll turn off the hose. - And I'll just wash my hands.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.570
Jong Yeon!

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.040
- Oh, my gosh! - You.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.810
- Let go of her. - Get out of the way!

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.420
- Stop it! Don't touch my friend! - Hey.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.950
You've got a lot of nerve.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.000
Jong Hee.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.329
What's his problem?

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.929
Guys, the water guns!

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.770
- Hurry! Quick! - The water guns.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.540
That's it!

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.639
- Hey! - Who do you think you are?

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.140
Come on, Jong Hee.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.320
Yeong Rye, what's the plan?

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.150
What does it look like? We're making a run for it.

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.450
Didn't I tell you?

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.620
I have a commercial driving license. Just in case.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:39.330
Oh, my gosh. Yeong Rye!

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.310
- Who are you? What do you want? - What?

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.750
Hey, Mister! What are you doing?

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.760
That's my scooter!

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:46.960
Stop!

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.470
I said stop!

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.300
Seo Jong Yeon, you stop right here!

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:17.990
- What's going on? - What?

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.300
Looks like there was an accident.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.900
There must be an accident.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.670
Jong Hee.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.310
Run, quick!

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:32.670
- Hurry up! - Right.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.790
Get over here!

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.790
Hey, isn't that Seo Jong Hee?

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:46.590
Get over here.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.389
Let go!

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.889
Thought you were pretty clever?

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.929
Even changing your name.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.360
Hey, where's my money?

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:02.640
And who are you?

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.690
No, this punk hit me first.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.519
I'm the victim here!

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.030
By that logic, you were first to attack Jong Hee.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:25.689
Weren't you?

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.460
What? I swear, this little pipsqueak...

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:29.700
Quiet!

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.070
And you tried to steal a scooter. What gives you the right to talk?

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.840
And you, Miss, took a company bus.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:41.080
First of all, the bus was returned, so take it up with your company.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.210
Gosh. I just ran a check on this guy.

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:45.710
I think you're going to want to see this.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.080
What?

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.850
What's this? Gambling, theft, and assault.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.589
Gosh. You've got quite the rap sheet.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.420
On top of that, you're wanted for fraud.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.390
You've got some serious nerve.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:59.059
And you have the audacity to raise your voice?

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.059
Hey, that's a separate issue. I'm the actual victim here.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.899
This wench ran off with my money.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.869
I was just trying to get the money my sister owes me.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:06.899
Is that a crime?

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.240
- Is it? - Excuse me!

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.669
What do you mean, a thief?

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.569
I've overheard some things, you know?

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:12.640
You're the one who...

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.479
No, I mean you. You're the one...

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.249
who gambled away all the money Jong Hee earned!

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.480
So the real thief...

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.779
would be you, Sir!

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.719
- What? - Goodness.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.390
Hey, take him inside for now.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.660
Let go of me!

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.659
Why is everyone ganging up on me?

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.190
I'm a victim here too.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.730
Hey, Seo Jong Yeon.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:35.730
Do you think changing your name changes who you are?

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.270
- I'm the victim! - Just hold still!

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.439
Seo Jong Yeon! Hey!

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.600
You...

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.229
Excuse me! You can't park here!

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.570
(Incheon Wonhwa Police Station)

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.610
I got a call to come here. I'm Ko Yeong Rye's guardian.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:18.670
Yeong Sik.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.080
Are you okay?

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.910
Are you hurt? Are you really okay?

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.650
I'm okay.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:31.890
You...

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.100
It was a case of mutual assault, so I thought you'd be in trouble.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.300
But he had a prior record and was wanted.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.370
Now that he's in lockup, he won't be getting out for a while.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.680
You must be Jae Pil.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:59.980
I'm the one who set you up with him for tutoring.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.650
- The eldest son of Hwashin. - I see.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.720
I'm so sorry for all the trouble today.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.420
I should get going.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.330
Jong Hee.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.470
I'll get going too.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.740
See you in class, Mr. Koh.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.640
Hey, Jae Pil. Wait.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.180
Please.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.790
Please, just leave me alone.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.660
I just...

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.700
Having you see me like this...

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.169
I feel like you've seen me at my absolute worst.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.600
It's so pathetic and humiliating, I could just die.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:33.980
So...

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.050
So why didn't you just look away and walk away?

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.880
Why...

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.089
Whether I was getting kicked out or beaten up,

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.459
you should've just stayed out of it and left!

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.490
Why!

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.960
Why...

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.250
It doesn't matter who you are,

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.760
how you've lived your life,

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.160
or who your family is.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.660
So please...

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.400
Like Yeong Rye,

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.670
let me stay by your side, even just as a friend.

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.320
Because I worry about you,

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.060
and I can't stop thinking about you,

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.400
and it's driving me crazy.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.010
What's gotten into him?

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.590
Oh, my goodness.

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:43.689
Gosh. What's wrong with this thing?

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:45.160
- Oh, dear. Are you okay? - Hey, Driver!

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.240
Gosh. There's a nail stuck deep in the tire.

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:00.280
We won't even make it to the depot like this.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.510
"Can't" is not an option. It has to get done.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.050
Besides, the bus is ancient.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.290
Well...

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.190
You want me to just figure it out somehow, right?

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.630
The weather...

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.650
My tools.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.250
Goodness.

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:45.090
What's with him?

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.960
Gosh. Good work.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.230
Hey, why are you being like this?

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:04.669
Did you eat something weird? Have you lost your mind?

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:06.270
You know why I'm doing this.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:09.200
Do you really hate me?

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.040
If you do, just say so. I'll let you go.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.180
What if people see us?

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.840
Well?

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.110
Well, then...

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:21.250
Should we go somewhere more private?

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:22.520
Oh, dear.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:37.430
How could you sleep like that for three hours straight?

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.430
I wasn't asleep the whole time.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.900
I woke up for a second whenever they handed out the test.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.270
Gosh.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.640
You know, I even had a dream. A total nightmare.

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.010
Seo Jong Nam suddenly started wringing my neck like this.

00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:50.680
I seriously thought I was going to die.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.220
Gosh.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.450
I wonder if it's safe to stay here and not run away.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.390
They said he won't be getting out for a while.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.960
Besides, where would you go without me?

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.630
Can you live without seeing me?

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.000
No, of course not.

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.270
I don't know anymore.

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:14.270
Whatever will be, will be.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.839
Oh, right.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.839
Jae Pil's done with his exam today, so we're supposed to meet up.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.840
Come with me.

00:57:18.841 --> 00:57:21.779
No, it's fine. I'm just going to go home and rest.

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.040
You two go ahead.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.510
What do you mean, "you two?"

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:27.080
Sang Cheol is joined at the hip, so you know he'll be there too.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.949
Come on, let's go. Our exams are over too.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:31.949
We could use a change of scenery. We can go for a bike ride?

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:34.689
But I pulled an all-nighter studying for this.

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:36.220
I'm dead tired. I really can't right now.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.530
You can sleep when you're dead, right?

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.699
Come with us.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.899
No, I'm not going. Leave me out of it.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.330
Come on, Koh Yeong Rye!

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:53.340
Hey!

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:56.110
Hey, Jae Pil. Wait up!

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.680
I told you I can't ride this thing!

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:07.090
Hey, Koh Yeong Rye! Wait up!

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.060
Jong Hee, hurry up!

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.960
I'm having so much fun!

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.100
Hey, Jae Pil!

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.469
- Hey, Han Jae Pil! - Hey, slow down!

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:19.570
I can't do it!

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:21.400
Gosh. Hey.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:25.410
This is fun!

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.580
One, two, three.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.910
There. Yes!

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.620
Gosh. How did you do that?

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.950
I think it's the rock.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.230
- Gosh. - Here, take this.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:47.230
And hold it like this.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:48.430
Don't hold your hand this way.

00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:50.199
Turn it horizontally, like this.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.900
Then you put the pressure right here.

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.300
And with a flick of the wrist...

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.610
Okay. Let me try.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.650
- Nice! - Did you see that?

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:09.819
Looks like my teaching paid off.

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:10.849
You're a natural.

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:12.490
Yeong Rye, let me show you how it's done.

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:13.760
Okay.

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.820
Hey, hand me a rock.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:19.730
Come on, hand it over properly.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.399
Hope you mess up!

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.700
Hey, stop it. Don't mess with me. This is serious right now.

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:25.800
There.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.500
Did you see that?

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.539
Hey, what's with that reaction?

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:34.140
Hey, teach me how to do that. Move over.

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:36.339
- Was that lame? - What? I think it looks cool.

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.379
I think you just gave me a bad rock.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.050
Hold it horizontally like this.

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.649
- Horizontally? - Yes.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:43.480
- Put the pressure right here. - Yes.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.520
And then you do this...

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.920
- Hey you're even better than me. - You're a natural.

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.090
Hey, she's taking a picture.

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.129
Kimchi!

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:56.000
One, two, three.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.400
Do you want some milk? It'll help with the spice.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.470
It's not because it's spicy.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.270
I'm fine.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:35.570
I think it's just because of the heat.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.569
Come on. Stop acting all tough for no reason.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:40.639
Or else your behind will be on fire...

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.980
If you're not going to drink it, I will.

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:50.520
Gosh. That's so rich.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.090
I never used to drink milk.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.819
Ever since Yeong Sik gave me some, I've really come to like it.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.490
My brother gave you milk?

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.090
Right, Jong Hee. Was that when you stayed with us?

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.299
Yes.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.600
I couldn't sleep, so I was out in the yard.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.570
And he brought me this, all warmed up.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.470
When I first met your brother,

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:11.140
I thought he'd be really cold and kind of gruff.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.610
But he's surprisingly thoughtful.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.250
Hey.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.590
- Are you okay? - Hey!

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.990
Did you burn yourself? Let me see your hand.

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.590
Are you okay? It's not hot?

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.530
I'm fine.

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:34.800
Here, use this to wipe it.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.200
- I'm fine. - Let me see your hand.

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:40.440
Hey, you...

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.769
You spilled that on purpose to avoid the spicy food, didn't you?

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:44.170
I can handle spicy food just...

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.779
Look at you.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.350
Goodness. Drink the milk!

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.850
Is it raining?

01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.149
It's really starting to pour.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.520
Okay, we can't stay here.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.690
- Let's get out of the rain, quick. - We got to run.

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:16.140
What about Jong Hee?

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.270
I don't know.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:20.010
I'm not sure.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.210
She was running right in front of me just a second ago.

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:30.720
It must be a passing shower.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.490
The forecast didn't say anything about rain.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.290
Tell me about it.

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:38.390
- It'll probably stop soon. - Yes.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.040
Where did this rain come from all of a sudden?

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:53.410
And I didn't even get to eat half my ramyeon.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.679
If you feel that bad,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.880
you can go finish your half ramyeon broth and half rainwater.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.080
Where did Yeong Rye and Jae Pil go?

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.620
They must be around here somewhere.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.090
But why don't you meet up with Yeong Rye?

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:11.659
What?

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.260
Don't you two have a thing for each other?

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.730
So why don't you see each other 1-on-1?

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:18.700
Just ask Yeong Rye on a date.

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:22.640
I don't know.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.110
Do you think Yeong Rye...

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.510
really likes me?

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.510
What?

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.010
And you two call yourselves best friends.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.380
You don't seem to know your own friend very well.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.520
Well, maybe I'm the one reading too much into things.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.590
When is this rain ever going to stop?

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.360
Who ever heard of rain coming out of nowhere like this?

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:51.600
Gosh.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.180
Do you want a piece?

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:12.590
It's so obvious you two are friends.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:40.280
Watch this.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.130
Gosh.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.640
How'd you do that?

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:06.340
Jong Hee said...

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.479
there's a trick to it.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.940
- Yes. - Here.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.590
Like this.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.670
Hey!

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:54.460
What?

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:02.230
My mom loved this song, so I grew to love it, too.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.340
I haven't heard this in forever.

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:19.810
On that day,

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.050
this song was playing.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.090
The day we first met.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.590
Are you okay?

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:36.800
And...

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.570
Oh?

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:19.240
The rain is letting up a little.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:21.280
Should we get going?

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:26.450
I was first.

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:38.790
I...

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.160
met you first.

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:44.800
Before Jong Hee.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.310
What?

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:56.880
The bus conductor who fought with a passenger over the fare.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.110
The one you helped out.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.750
That was me.

01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:06.790
We met at the movie theater, too.

01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:10.490
The group date was our third time meeting.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:15.460
It was truly like destiny.

01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:20.400
No wonder.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:25.510
You looked so familiar from the moment I first saw you.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.540
And...

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:32.280
the one who fell for you first...

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.820
was me.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.390
I tried to tell you so many times.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.930
But you never gave me a chance.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.430
Just once,

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.570
can't you give me...

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.740
a chance too?

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.389
- Free candy for the pretty lady. - Thank you.

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:51.460
It's a heart-shaped candy.

01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:59.500
Yeong Rye.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.170
Koh Yeong Rye?

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:04.910
Yes?

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.310
Are you coming?

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.540
Right.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.410
I am.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.699
My heart wants to say this to you today,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.729
Where are they?

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:31.699
Even though it may never reach you.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.929
They couldn't have gone far.

01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:34.070
At least this once,

01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:36.970
- I'm letting it have a voice. - Let's look for them.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.340
And now,

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.480
I'm finally going to end this one-sided love.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.250
Goodbye, my first crush.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.350
Farewell, my first love.

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:04.570
(Cheongah Bus)

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:07.530
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.600
Two, two, three, four,

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.939
five, six, seven. One more time.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:17.510
One, two, three, four,

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:21.750
five, six, seven, eight.

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:25.150
Two, two, three, four,

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:31.630
five, six, seven, and over.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.800
All right, everyone, focus up!

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.970
Let's give it our all again today, okay?

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:41.870
And your deposits have been a little short lately.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.670
You all know that, right?

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.370
You all know our company motto, right?

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:49.010
"Treat our passengers like family."

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:51.709
Even if we're completely packed, we squeeze in one more person.

01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:54.180
Pack them in tight!

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.019
Okay, dismissed!

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.450
(Cheongah Bus)

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:02.890
Right. Hold on! Stop!

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.830
He sure has a fancy way of saying "drive with the doors open."

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.500
Since when do you treat family like a piggy bank?

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:12.670
Tell me about it.

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:16.700
By the way, looks like Jeong Bun stayed out all night again.

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:19.140
Her mom must be really sick?

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.510
I guess so.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.040
I mean, she went home and then called in sick from there.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.450
Alright!

01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:28.220
And one more thing.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.590
Someone called in sick today, so the dispatch schedule's a mess.

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:35.920
Anyone who's off today or has a light schedule...

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.220
Who can cover for her?

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:39.590
Who can cover for her?

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:42.400
I'll cover for her.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.900
Good. You're close with Jeong Bun. You can cover for her today.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.800
Dismissed!

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.219
"Giant."

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.870
Excuse me. Please exit slowly.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.070
Go ahead, get on.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.440
Please move a little further inside.

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.580
Slowly now, take your time!

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.549
Move in a little more!

01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:08.450
- Hurry up! - Can you go in more?

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.250
Careful getting on.

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.590
We're already packed, here!

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:13.750
A little more!

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.289
Alright, we're good.

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.530
- Come on. Seriously? - Miss.

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.559
Hey, I can see some space up front.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.930
Come on. Move in more.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.930
Miss. Please let me get on!

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.600
- I'm really going to be late! - Let's go!

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.140
- Please! - Stop pushing!

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:35.739
Hurry, get on.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.679
- Thank you. - A little further inside!

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.749
Thank you so much.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:40.080
There is no space here!

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:41.680
Thank you.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.250
- A little further inside! - We can't!

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.420
Stop pushing!

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320
All clear!

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.440
Do you think Yeong Rye really likes me?

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.840
And you two call yourselves best friends.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:12.550
You don't seem to know your own friend very well.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.550
Well...

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.420
My gut says it's a guy.

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:23.290
A guy? What are you talking about?

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:34.470
Hey.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.900
- Are you okay? - Hey!

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.370
Did you burn yourself? Let me see your hand.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:41.040
Are you okay? It's not hot?

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.810
I'm fine.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.080
Here, use this to wipe it.

(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.480
- Hold on. - What was that?

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.390
Someone call for help!

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:27.190
Somebody call an ambulance!

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.430
Darn it. Call an ambulance!

01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:47.240
