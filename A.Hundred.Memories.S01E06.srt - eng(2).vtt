life really is...

We heard Hae Ja got hurt. We're going to the hospital.

I'm the one going to the hospital!

What good will you do there? Pay for her surgery?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.170
Are you going to go into the operating room instead of her?

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.369
Then those with a scheduled route will go.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.409
Ok Hui and I don't have a shift, so we'll go.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.379
Yes, please let us go, sir.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.950

Hae Ja...

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.740

He...

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.130
asked me to give this to you.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.830
I have a full shift that day.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.800
So I didn't even have time anyway.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.040
I'll cover your shift.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.709
Jae Pil's done with his exam today, so we're supposed to meet up.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.710
Come with me.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.579
No, it's fine. I'm just going to go home and rest.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.680
You two go ahead.

(Wonhwa Jaeil Hospital)

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.970
We did everything we could to save it.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.500
But the nerves were severed, so amputation was unavoidable.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.110
Hae Ja.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.150
Hey, why are you crying? Don't cry.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.650
I'm not dead.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.820
Hae Ja.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.660
Are you okay?

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.360
Doesn't it hurt?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.829
Well...

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.630
They said that with the morphine, it should be bearable for now.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.630
But...

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.140
If I start getting phantom pains,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.010
they said it might be unbearable.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.480
The nurse said to call her if it hurts.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.250
I'm so sorry, Hae Ja.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.620
If I hadn't bailed on my shift and just come in yesterday,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.550
then this never would've happened.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.750
It's all my fault.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.720
I'm so sorry, Hae Ja.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.430
Forget it. There's no one to blame.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.000
It's my own fault for being greedy and pushing myself too hard.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.040
Anyway, why haven't we heard from the company?

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.940
The hospital bill must be huge.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.640
And still not a word from them?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.940
No way.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.480
They'll cover it.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.550
It was a workplace accident.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.380
I'll look into it for you.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.290
Yes, thanks. You know the most about that stuff.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.030
I'm counting on you, Yeong Rye.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.800
What is that supposed to mean?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.730
What do you mean the company's not responsible?

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.669
But this was a workplace accident.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.639
How is the company not responsible? Does that make any sense?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.070
Of course, it makes sense.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.309
Why wouldn't it? I mean, to be blunt,

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.750
did anyone twist Kwon Hae Ja's arm to take that dispatch?

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.449
That happened because she got greedy and insisted on going, right?

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.649
It was an accident due to an individual's poor judgment.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.750
Why should the company take the fall for her accident?

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.960
Do you think the company is that easy to take advantage of?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.929
- But even so... - Sir.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.960
Hae Ja was just trying to be a diligent worker.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.560
I've cleared it with corporate, so drop it.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.970
My head is killing me.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.470
What do you mean you've cleared it?

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.600
Hae Ja lost her leg.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.970
How can you possibly say this is settled?

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.110
Gosh, Ms. Koh. You're getting on my nerves today!

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.509
It's none of your business.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.610
Why are you getting involved like this?

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.480
Let me be blunt.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.120
Because of Kwon Hae Ja,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.090
the dispatch schedule's a mess, and the company's losing a fortune.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.490
We could sue her for damages,

00:09:42.491 --> 00:09:44.489
so she should consider herself lucky we haven't.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.420
How frustrating. Seriously.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.270
Watch your mouth. Got it?

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.980
That's absurd.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.110
The company isn't responsible?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.850
Who do they think we work so hard for with our own two hands,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.019
cramming people into rusty tin cans they call buses?

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.150
Exactly.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.090
They've gone way too far. Those heartless punks.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.330
So what should we do?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.430
Hae Ja.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.430
I heard she doesn't have a penny to her name.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.230
That's why I called this meeting.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.770
I think maybe we...

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.840
need to step up and do something.

Help yourselves, everyone!

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.020
Just eat a little. You don't want to get carsick again.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.430
Everyone.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.530
Thank you all for coming.

What I'm about to say...

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.240
concerns our safety and our rights.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.040
I'm sure you've all heard,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.040
but this accident with Kwon Hae Ja...

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.180
is something that could happen to any one of us.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.050
They don't even properly inspect the ageing buses.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.380
They pressure us to drive off with the doors still open.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.990
And for any problems that arise from that,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.060
the company pushes all the blame onto us...

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.120
and refuses to take any responsibility.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.930
If we let them get away with this injustice,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.260
then the next time something happens,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.400
the company won't be there to protect us either.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.970
That's why...

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.140
I think we...

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.710
need to stand together.

We know there are risks involved in our line of work,

but we have human rights too.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.979
But the company has no intention of protecting them,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.020
not even in the slightest.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.490
Just look at what happened in Hae Ja's accident.

Hey, Ms. Koh.

And keep your hands to yourself.

That's right. Let's talk.

- I'll be so late for work! - It's because...

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.199
all the conductors are on strike right now.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.440
Take your complaint to the company, not me.

- Hey, I... - Where do you think you're going?

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.349
Who's going to drive if you run off? Honestly.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.419
- Then hurry up and get on. - Goodness.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.819
- This is so chaotic, seriously. - My hair is a mess now!

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.479
Get on, quick. There might not be another one.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.220

"All right," my foot. Now I have to do this too?

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.629
- Yes, I understand. - Our conductors are on strike.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.959
- We're very sorry. - The buses aren't running.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.700
- Yes, we are extremely sorry. - Of course.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.839
- Sure. - Yes, Cheongah Bus.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.369
- Yes, we do apologise. - I'm so sorry.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.540
It's because the conductors have collectively gone on strike.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.939
We're terribly sorry. We're trying to fix it quickly.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.139
- Look. I get it, but... - We're so sorry.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.349
We're at our wits' end, and you want a note explaining why we're late?

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.549
- Yes? - Yes, we're looking into...

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.749
Hello?

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.350
- Why are you cursing at me? - Hello?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.620
Hello? Why is the connection so bad?

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.860
- For goodness' sake. - Yes, we're terribly sorry.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.270
What do we do? If this continues, it'll disrupt our operations...

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.500
Quiet! Hurry and unplug all the phones!

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.970
- Unplug them? All of them? - All of them!

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.410
Where's the person in charge here?

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.039
I want to see the person in charge!

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040
- Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my gosh.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040
Are you in charge?

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.939
- Yes, how may I help you? - Don't give me that.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.550
It's because of your darn buses!

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.510
I lost out on a huge contract today!

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.420

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.690
Let go of me!

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.249
How will you make this right?

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.719
- Answer me, now! - Sir!

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.230
Answer me right now!

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.620
- Jong Hee. - Yes?

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.990
Stand up for a second.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.660
Sit here. This cushion is thicker.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.159
No, it's okay. You sit.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.660
No, really, I'm fine.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.230
I've got plenty of padding back here.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.950
Koh Yeong Rye.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.450
Yes?

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.120
Why are you always the one to give in?

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160
Am I?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.730
You know you are.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.760
Even at meals, you always give me the best dishes.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.630
When the bathroom's crowded, you always let me go first.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.430
And when it comes to our routes,

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.140
you always switch with me for the easier one.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.670
And...

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.940
Hey.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.240
I'm not like that at all.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.080
The side dishes?

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.320
I only gave them to you because they're not my favourite.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.820
And the bathroom? I don't even remember that.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.449
And honestly, with the routes,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.760
you've covered my shifts way more often.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.160
Besides,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.300
I wasn't even going to bring this up, but...

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.700
I do have a bit of curve back there, so I've got plenty of cushion.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.410
As if.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.940
No way.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880
I'm serious!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.350
I get it from my mom.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.530
Where are you going?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.270
To the bathroom.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.210
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.950
Oh, gosh. Just a second.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.250
Yes, hello?

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.590
Yes, hello?

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.260
Well, I'm doing fine,

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.630
but may I ask who's calling?

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.330
I'm...

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.970
I'm Seo Jong Hee. I'm a friend of Jae Pil's.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.900
"Seo Jong Hee?"

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.440
Oh, my. Then are you Jae Pil's girlfriend?

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.979
- Please hold on a moment. - Honey.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.509
Jae Pil, it's for you!

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.510
I'm hungry.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.509
Honey, come to the room. We need to talk.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.379
- About what? - We have something to discuss.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380
Let's talk in the room.

00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:21.520
It's a girl.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.620
Let's go.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
Hello?

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.230
Hello?

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.670
Seo Jong Hee?

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.540
Yes, it's me.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.010
What were you up to?

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.110
Studying.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.909
I made a big promise to my father, so I'm trying, but it isn't easy.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.020
My fundamentals are pretty weak.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.280
You've got this.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.260
This Saturday...

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.760
Do you think...

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.560
we could meet?

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.400
Yes, of course.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.700
Actually...

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.200
I wish I could see you right now.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.040
Okay, then.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.240
Let's meet at the Wonhwa-dong Intersection at 12pm.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.080
Make sure you look sharp, Han Jae Pil.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520
Got it?

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.920
(Demands: Cover the injured bus conductor's medical bill.)

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.959
(Bus conductors are people too.)

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.930
(People came before buses, not the way around.)

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.310
So...

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.080
You're determined to continue this, even if you have to camp all night?

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:55.950
Okay.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.480
Fine.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.550
Looks like you want to take this all the way.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.590
I'll give you exactly one day.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.120
Anyone who returns to work by tomorrow...

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.390
will face no repercussions.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.560
Anyone who doesn't...

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.160
will be fired on the spot. Make no mistake.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.640
I have made my warning clear.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.979
Just...

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.180
one day.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.590
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.799
The company has no intention of meeting our demands.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.030
At this rate,

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.600
aren't we all just going to get fired?

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.200
Yeong Rye.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.200
I'm sorry,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.810
but I really can't afford to get fired.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.440
I have a lot of younger siblings to support.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.110
I don't think I can be a part of this anymore.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.880
- I'm sorry. - Wait.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.720
I never thought they'd actually fire us.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.420
I'm really sorry.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.320
Hey, wait up!

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.660
Guys.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.900
(People came before buses, not the way around.)

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.840
This isn't going to work.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.450
We need to figure something out.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.179
Are you going straight home?

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.219
Do you want a ride?

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.589
- You drove here? - Yes.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.360
My mom went with my dad on his business trip to Australia.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.890
So both of their cars are available.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760
Yeong Sik!

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.360
Hey there, Ugly.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.310
We almost missed each other.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.340
How did you know we were at the library?

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.210
She's here for me, not us.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.050
Whatever, you jerk. Stop nitpicking.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.180
Gosh. Here.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.320
Mom said you'd be getting home late from the library today.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.760
Like I mentioned briefly,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.590
the situation at my company is pretty urgent.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.830
Yeong Sik.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.760
I mean...

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.230
We really need your help.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.199
So, the company is refusing to accept blame for the accident,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.570
and if you continue the strike, they'll fire everyone.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.240
They're basically threatening you, right?

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.680
That company has no class.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.350
If they were injured on the job, that's a clear workers' comp case.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.890
If you let this slide now,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.420
this kind of thing will just keep happening.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.130
In conditions this poor, open-door departure accidents...

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.190
are just going to keep happening.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.730
I understand where you're coming from,

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.170
but there's a legal process for strikes, you know?

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.540
Your strike didn't go through a cooling-off period,

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.680
so technically, it is illegal.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.910
Even so,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.419
the fact that the company hasn't reported you...

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.789
means they're not so clean either.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.720
Like you said, Yeong Rye,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.260
the company's position was to never negotiate in the first place.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.120
As for them threatening to fire you,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.030
I think that was just a bluff to scare you all.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.830
"A bluff?"

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.699
The Constitution guarantees three basic labour rights.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.699
These three rights protect your right to pursue happiness.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.900
They're your fundamental rights as workers.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.769
So that means, under the Constitution's Article 33,

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.480
you have the right to make legitimate demands.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.250
Well, it gets a little complicated if you get into the details.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.680
So, you're saying...

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.280
Even if we keep holding out,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.150
the company can't just fire us whenever they want, right?

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.620
Bingo.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.460
That's all I needed to hear.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.390
That's the answer I was hoping for.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.500
That said, if the stand-off drags on, you'll lose your advantage.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.229
The company will do whatever it can to find replacement workers...

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.630
and keep the buses running.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.040
You'll all get exhausted,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.040
and eventually, more people will start to drop out.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.510
Then what do we do?

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.510
If we stop now,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.780
it'll be worse than if we never started at all.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.720
And what about Hae Ja's hospital bills?

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.520
You're right.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.020
This is a really tough situation.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.060
But in a situation like this,

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.200
there is one way to make the company back down.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.340
Okay, get home safe.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.310
I'll drop Yeong Rye off. I have an errand over there anyway.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.550
- Let's go. - Really?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.350
Thank you, Hyeon.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.890
Well, I'll get going, then.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.690
Bye.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.990
I thought you said you were giving me a ride.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.630
Goodness.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.510
Gosh. You've got some serious guts, Ugly.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.080
Why did you decide to take the lead on something like that?

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.950
That's not something just anyone can do.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.580
You're tougher than you look.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.660
Goodness. You must've been exhausted.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.730
What?

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.630
You're awake?

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.430
Talk about perfect timing. We just got here.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.270
Really?

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.640
It feels like it's been well over an hour.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.710
There was an accident,

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.440
so we were stuck in traffic for a while.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.550
Maybe that's why you slept so soundly.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.550
Lucky you, Ugly.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.990
Thank you, Hyeon.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.960
I had such a comfortable ride, thanks to you.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.030
Yes, it sure looked like you were comfortable.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:27.430
You were even snoring.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.670
What? I was?

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.500
No, I'm just kidding.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.270
Fighting for your cause is vital, but take care of yourself.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.470
And remember what I told you earlier.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.540
Bye. Drive safely.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.380
Okay, hurry inside. Your friends must be waiting.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.160
- Hey, Hyeon. - Yes?

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.990
Have I ever told you this?

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.760
That you remind me of Daddy-Long-Legs.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600
"Daddy-Long-Legs?"

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.270
In the book "Daddy-Long-Legs,"

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.270
when the main character is at the lowest point in her life,

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.410
the one who gives her strength and supports her...

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.240
is her Daddy-Long-Legs.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.480
And that's who you are to me.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.250
Great. Happy now that you've turned me into an old man?

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.120
Go on, get inside.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.900
Daddy-Long-Legs?

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.770
Not bad, I guess.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.580
I guess I should've been a bit taller.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.590
Thank you.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.720
I've asked you to come by my office, but you never showed up.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.190
My goodness, what brings you here so late at night?

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.330
I was just in the neighbourhood.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.170
Are you here for some career advice?

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.500
I heard your sister wants you to study abroad.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.570
She's hoping you'll take over the company.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.110
I'm still thinking about it.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.280
Becoming a judge or prosecutor and deciding who's right or wrong...

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.510
is a little daunting.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.280
- But that's not why I'm here. - Yes.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.480
Uncle.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.490
You said you have a close friend at the Dongseong Daily, right?

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.160
(Cheongah Bus)

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.699
(A bus conductor was injured on shift!)

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.970
(People came before buses, not the way around.)

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.810
(Chungah Bus is dodging the open-door departure accident.)

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.110
(Guarantee the safety of bus conductors.)

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.879
Wait! Stop them! Don't let them in!

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.219
- Stop them! What are you doing? - Everybody, get up!

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.389
- No! - You can't just barge in like this!

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.089
- Stop them! - You can't do this.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.259
- Manager, over here! - What?

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.229
What is wrong with you people? This is completely out of line!

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.230
Yes!

00:33:10.231 --> 00:33:12.999
I mean, without any prior notice or an official request...

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.199
What story? What is there to even report?

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.869
It's about the bus accident with the open doors.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.899
We heard a conflict arose between the conductors and the company,

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.040
and that they're on strike now.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.910
First, we'd like to cover the strike and interview a conductor.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.379
Then we'll get the company's side of the story as well.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.679
The company has no comment. Got it?

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.249
I'm telling you, this isn't even newsworthy.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.120
They're blaming us for an accident that was their own fault.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.220
What do you expect us to do?

00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:36.849
That's exactly what we're here to investigate.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.160
We need to hear from both sides, don't you think?

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.760
We already have someone to interview from the conductors' side.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.129
Ms. Koh Yeong Rye.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.130
What?

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360
Koh Yeong Rye?

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.830
I'm Koh Yeong Rye!

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.040
I am Koh Yeong Rye.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.939
Where should we do the interview?

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.709
First, let's get some shots of the conductors on strike here.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.920
We'd like to do the interview with the protest in the background.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.879
Okay, let's hurry and start filming here.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.489
- Yes. - Stop! What are you filming?

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.490
What are you filming?

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.890
I don't know who tipped them off,

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.630
but Dongseong Daily found out and came running.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.729
If that kind of story gets out in the press,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.130
it's going to look bad for us.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.240
Yes, I understand.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.870
Yes. I'll do that.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.280
Seriously.

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:37.910
What'd they say?

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.320
Honestly.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980
So?

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.810
What did headquarters say?

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.780
What did they say?

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.690
You guys won.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.690
Kwon Hae Ja's hospital bills...

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.660
and her severance pay.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.430
Headquarters has agreed to pay for it all.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.430
So, break it up now!

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.400
Do it.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.669
What?

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.670
We're done!

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.250
We won!

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.250
We won.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.990
- We won! - We won!

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:56.760
Everyone! This is all thanks to our Koh Yeong Rye!

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.929
- Koh Yeong Rye! - Koh Yeong Rye!

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.999
- Koh Yeong Rye! - Koh Yeong Rye!

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.770
- Koh Yeong Rye! - Koh Yeong Rye!

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.710
So...

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.640
The hospital bills are taken care of,

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.610
and I'm getting compensation?

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.020
Yes, Hae Ja.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.290
Honestly...

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.390
When I first heard what happened,

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.490
I thought this was the end of the line for me.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.060
The company abandoned me.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.430
I had no idea how to handle this situation.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.500
I'm so glad everything worked out, Hae Ja.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.170
This time, though,

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.170
Yeong Rye really worked so hard.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.880
It wasn't just me.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.479
It was only possible because everyone stuck together.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.210
If I had done it alone, I wouldn't have stood a chance.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.020
Thank you, Koh Yeong Rye.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.560
And all the rest of you, too.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.030
To be honest,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.300
as your dorm leader all this time,

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.940
I always just did whatever I wanted and bossed you all around.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.270
I was so mean.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.610
And yet,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.340
you still did all this for me.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.420
Well, you did have your moments.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.590
What? Why the sudden respect?

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.290
What happened to insisting that we were the same age?

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.460
Now that...

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.700
all our worries are over,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.830
and only good things are ahead.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.270
So just focus on your treatment, Hae Ja.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:46.970
Yes, I will.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.510
I'm going to start physical therapy first thing tomorrow.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.340
My therapist...

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.340
turns out he's super handsome.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.680
I'm planning to make my move.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.079
Seriously? At a time like this?

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.450
Now that sounds like our Hae Ja.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.120
Oh, right. There's more news.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.360
It's about Driver Kim.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.660
They say he's going to Dongjin Bus.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.530
Wait. Driver Kim?

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.129
Which Driver Kim?

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:15.799
What do you mean, "which Driver Kim?"

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.170
That womanizer, Driver Kim, of course.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:18.470
Unbelievable.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.040
I wonder what kind of trouble he'll stir up at Dongjin Bus.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.710
What are you talking about? Can you explain?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.650
So it's true that you're going to Dongjin Bus?

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.560
But why so suddenly?

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.090
Without even saying a word to me.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.660
Well, it wasn't exactly sudden.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.230
There's been talk about it for a while.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.500
This is nice.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.140
This ssanghwa tea is really good.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.140
We should start coming here from now on, right?

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.880
Then what about us?

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.650
What's going to happen to us?

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.350
Us?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.580
What's the big deal?

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.490
Just because I'm going to Dongjin Bus doesn't mean we can't meet.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.760
We can meet on my days off.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.730
And we can still run into each other now and then.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.700
You won't try to see me.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.330
Not me, anyway.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.610
You're just done with me, right?

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.070
What?

00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:33.580
You'll just hit on the conductors there.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.210
A leopard can't change its spots.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.949
You think a womanizer is going to stop playing his games?

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.549
How can you say that to me?

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.019
Are you calling me a womanizer right now?

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.590
There's nothing more to say.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:46.390
I'm going to...

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.690
give you one last piece of advice.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.129
Stop living such a sleazy life.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.300
- You'll get what's coming to you. - Jeong Bun.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.230
Jeong Bun, why the foul language?

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.300
If you're going to be like this, I can't see you anymore, Jeong Bun.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.540
I'm the one who's done. I won't see you.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.309
Darn it, I should just sew that mouth of yours shut.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.540
You've got some nerve.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.110
Get your life straight, you hear?

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.780
If you make others cry,

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.420
you'll shed tears of blood.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.770
Womanizer, my foot.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.190
It's good to see you, Seo Jong Hee.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.660
It's been way too long, hasn't it?

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.630
Tell me about it. It has been a while.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.640
It's been a whirlwind at the company these past few days.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.240
- We even went on strike. - Really?

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.640
So that's why the buses weren't running.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.240
- How about now? - It's all sorted out.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.410
Yeong Rye worked really hard on it.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.579
She even stepped up to lead the strike.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.019
Really?

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.990
I didn't know Yeong Rye had that kind of backbone.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.450
That's a surprise.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.790
Oh, right.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.030
Here, have a seat.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.140
I was getting one for myself and bought one for you too.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.770
I thought they'd look good on you.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240
Gosh.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.150
Try them on.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.420
- Should I? - Yes.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.090
They're a perfect fit.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:38.930
How did you know my size?

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:40.230
I just eyeballed it.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.160
I figured we could exchange them if they didn't fit.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.870
Sang Cheol, that idiot, always says you shouldn't give shoes as a gift.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.110
He says they'll use them to run away from you.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.340
But I've never believed in things like that.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.450
Where would you even go without me?

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.280
Right?

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.890
Wearing these,

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.390
let's go have some fun today.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.860
What should we do? Anything you want.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.230
- I get to choose? - Yes.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.930
In that case...

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.639
Since I get to choose,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.370
how about we get out of the neighbourhood for once?

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.060
I took most of it.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.460
Are you okay?

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.790
Here, let's trade.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:45.730
Here.

00:43:45.731 --> 00:43:48.460
(Haunted House)

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.200
Gosh. Look at that!

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.170
Look over there.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.020
Watch this.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.830
Gosh, it's so beautiful, right?

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.940
- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.810
That looks delicious, right?

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.040
- Should I try it? - Go ahead.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.250
Is it good?

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.520
You got some on your face.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.230
Wait. We're not going home already, are we?

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.200
Do you want me to tell you?

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:04.470
What is it?

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.510
Are you going to do it this time?

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:12.450
No.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:39.410
Here, let me see.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.040
- Is it bad? - No, it's fine.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.380
- Give it here. I'll put it on. - I've got it.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.150
It's an awkward spot. Let me help.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.750
Oh, no.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.360
New shoes usually need some time to be broken in.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.800
We walked too much today.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.270
I wasn't thinking.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.170
I'm sorry.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.520
Next time,

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.820
let's just stay in one place and not move an inch.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:31.290
There...

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.430
won't be a next time.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.500
What?

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.600
What's that supposed to mean?

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:42.740
Let's...

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.980
Let's just end it here.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.220
We're too different.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.560
We grew up in different worlds, and I don't have a mom or a dad,

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.260
I just have a brother I'd like to kill sometimes.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.700
But that's something you already know.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.200
But now that we're actually together,

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.900
it's become painfully clear how different we are.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.370
And I'm exhausted from the strike, too.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.249
That's insane. To just do this out of the blue...

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:26.250
You're right.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.750
This is just who I am.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.620
Impulsive and selfish.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.920
I'm fickle and too proud for my own good.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.760
So let's end this before you're completely sick of me.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.100
I'm sorry.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.400
No.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:47.900
Don't be sorry.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.670
I can't accept this.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.770
- Jae Pil. - Why are you doing this?

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.580
I mean, why all of a sudden?

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.510
What changed your mind?

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.619
We were happy, weren't we?

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.350
Yes, it was good. It was.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.760
But it wasn't all good.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:12.390
You said it yourself. That new shoes need breaking in.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.400
But with us,

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.600
there are too many obstacles in the way.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.240
We'll probably always feel uncomfortable...

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.140
like we're wearing shoes that don't fit.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:27.180
I guess...

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.280
This is as far as my feelings for you go.

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.960
Thanks for the band-aid.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.040
Take care.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:57.670
And make sure you get into college.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.700
Seo Jong Hee.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840
Are you...

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.440
really okay with never seeing me again?

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.180
Just like this?

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.850
You're really ending it just like that?

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.250
Yes.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.160
It's not like we've been together that long.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.130
Jong Hee!

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.870
You said you were meeting Jae Pil, so why...

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.810
Hey, what's wrong?

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:15.040
Did something happen?

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.510
What is it? What's wrong, Jong Hee?

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.480
What is it?

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.990
This is for the best.

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:27.790
This is for the best.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.760
It can't be helped.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.660
Here's the weather.

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:41.059
Today, an earlier than usual first snow of the season...

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.660
is forecast across the country.

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:50.240
First snow? But it's only November.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.940
No way.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.380
Tell me about it.

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.980
But it sure has gotten chilly all of a sudden.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:02.380
Oh, my.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:10.530
Why are you blocking the way?

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.500
Hey, now.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.600
What's gotten into him now?

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.039
It has to be wiped perfectly clean.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.840
He's always picking on Yeong Rye these days.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.779
Where is Mudeung Mountain tiger?

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.080
It should come take that punk.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.490
One, two, three.

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.460
Goodness. That's so loud.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:49.699
Darn it. Of all the days, why'd he set up right there.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.900
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.400
Gosh. I messed it up again.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:56.809
This airplane one is way too hard.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.340
I can do the hat shape with my eyes closed now.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.910
That scared me!

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.979
That scared me. Sae Ri!

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.080
You made me break it again.

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:09.479
Why are you always so jumpy?

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.190
She startles at every little thing.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.260
All right. Again.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.860
Okay, focus up.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.260
Wait, is that my wife?

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.460
Stop.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.130
Back up.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:59.630
What do you think you're doing here?

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.000
- You scared me. - Dad.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.170
So this is what you've been up to when you're not home.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.210
Out on the street with our daughter, eating junk food?

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.140
We're going home!

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.049
- Get in! Now! - All right.

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:12.980
Why are you yelling like that?

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.579
Let me just get this one last thing. I'm so close to getting it.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.820
Seriously, this woman.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.720
And the housekeeper's off today!

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.260
I'm hungry!

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:22.820
I need to get dinner on the table!

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.160
Hurry and get in. Sae Ri, get in.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.530
- Come on, hurry. Get in. - Gosh. Seriously.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.870
Man Ok is saying she'll leave as soon as she gets it.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.770
It's not like getting this takes an hour.

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.869
You won't pass out from hunger if dinner's a little late, right?

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.340
- Am I right? - What's with this lady?

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.810
Are you going to let go of me or what?

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:40.980
I won't.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.340
I can't let go.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.179
Not until you let go of his hand, sir.

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.150
It's just lipstick on a pig, you know.

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:50.690
A truly respectable person should cherish their spouse.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.690
You're doing this on the street, in front of a cheap snack vendor.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.160
How could you humiliate her like this?

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.240
Be home in 30 minutes.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:13.070
Or else...

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.450
You're getting kicked out.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:31.990
Don't be late!

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.300
Oh, my gosh. You were incredible.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:47.639
You sent infamous Han Gi Bok away just like that.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.640
Gosh.

00:56:48.641 --> 00:56:51.710
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:53.979
That was so incredibly satisfying!

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:55.620
Hey, not in front of the kid.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.150
Hurry up and get your prize before you get kicked out.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:01.190
He won't kick me out. He's all talk.

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:04.530
But seriously, that was so satisfying.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.460
You're really...

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.649
These fried anchovies are well-salted.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.910
They're mighty tasty.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.750
Jeong Bun, you've been eating so much lately.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:30.690
At this rate, you'll eat us out of house and home.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.930
But I'm just so curious, I have to ask.

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:38.330
Jong Hee.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.160
Why on earth did you and your boyfriend break up?

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.200
Yes, I've been wondering that myself.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.500
You were so crazy about each other. What happened?

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.140
There was no reason.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.870
That's just how relationships are.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:52.909
People meet, and people break up.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:55.040
You can be crazy about someone, and then just get tired of them.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:57.510
I get bored easily.

00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:58.810
I'm just really fickle.

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.949
But still, Jong Hee, you two were...

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:02.950
That's enough.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:05.390
I told you not to bring that up.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.830
Eat.

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:14.000
Come on, eat up.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.370
I'm telling you to slow down.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.609
The way you're eating,

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:26.710
anyone would think you're pregnant...

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:32.210
Don't tell me.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.380
You're not, are you?

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:39.290
Hey!

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.320
Even as a joke,

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.360
you can't say that to an unmarried woman.

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.870
How did this happen?

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.570
Who is he?

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:05.779
Jeong Bun, why would you do that?

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:07.680
What were you thinking?

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:08.850
Ho Suk.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.920
The one who is the most overwhelmed right now...

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:12.820
isn't us, it's Jeong Bun.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:15.390
The father.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.160
Does the father know?

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.290
Does he even know?

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.030
This is insane, seriously.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:31.070
I'm getting rid of it.

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.280
I have to. What other choice do I have?

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:39.350
A baby without a father...

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.550
How am I supposed to raise a child on my own?

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.370
Hey.

00:59:58.330 --> 00:59:59.700
Come work out with me today.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.100
You've been studying like a maniac lately.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.970
How can you stay glued to your chair without a single bathroom break?

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.740
Seriously, you're starting to scare me.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.480
Are you even listening?

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:11.110
Come on, let's go.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.779
We can hit the heavy bag a bit. Get some fresh air.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.420
The weather's so nice out, you know?

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:18.789
Hey, and let's be real here.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.460
Is Seo Jong Hee the only girl in the world or something?

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.229
A guy with your looks, your money, and your personality.

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.530
If you just so much as wink at them...

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:28.560
Girls would be lining up by the truckload for you!

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:34.570
I'm sorry.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.040
That's why I'm saying we should go!

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.270
This doesn't add up.

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:42.610
None of it adds up.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.180
Ms. Gye.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.950
The secret inspector's headcount, from corporate,

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:54.620
and the deposit amount here. Why don't they match at all?

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.690
Nothing adds up at all.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.230
Are you sure you calculated this correctly?

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.430
I did calculate it correctly.

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:03.929
Those inspectors come undercover, but act like they can't be bothered.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:05.129
They do a sloppy job counting.

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.869
So of course the headcount is going to be off.

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:08.339
All right, that's enough.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340
Quiet.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.240
These corporate guys...

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.780
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.650

You think you can get away with playing dumb?

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:40.200
The deposit amount is off!

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.970
I'm telling you, that's impossible.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.040
I'm sure I collected the fare...

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.940
from every single passenger that day,

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.579
and I deposited the exact amount I received.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.909
Then why is the headcount the corporate inspector took...

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.309
different from the amount you deposited?

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.950
The answer is pretty obvious.

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.290
Either the money grew wings and flew away,

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.660
or someone skimmed off the top.

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.290
Are you...

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.760
accusing me right now?

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.060
Yes.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.100
I am.

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.430
Why? What?

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.140
Do you have proof that you didn't?

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.140
Out of all things, I would never steal.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.840

Are your schedules not lining up?

01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.480
She keeps...

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:08.150
coming here by herself?

Yes.

01:04:09.351 --> 01:04:10.590
She doesn't stay long.

01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:11.990
She just requests this one song,

01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:14.460
listens to it on repeat a few times, and then leaves.

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.920
