[Episode 23]

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.920
Sir, reporting.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560
She doesn't have much time left.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.000
Why is that?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.310
She's so young.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.120
How could it happen?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.120
Her heart suffered a severe injury

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.430
with multiple complications.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.840
Her body is worn out.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.590
There's no saving now.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.580
[Flowers never fade, the moon shines
eternal, two hearts beat as one]

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.750
Mr. Gu!

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.840
Our men keeping watch
on Gu Tongce have news.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.660
[Ministry of Military Affairs]

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.120
Are these the military supplies
we intercepted?

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.560
Yes. I had men tracking these
for a long time.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.710
Shouldn't be wrong.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.360
I heard that last year
was especially cold,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.910
and many of the Military Governor's
soldiers froze to death.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.960
I thought it was a natural disaster,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.710
but it was man-made.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.590
They swapped out military supplies,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.560
passing off shoddy goods as real.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.630
Gu Tongce is audacious beyond measure.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960
This

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.710
happens with every warlord.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.590
They only care about their own profit.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.150
I wonder how much Gu Tongce

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.590
has skimmed off.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.120
These warlords sit idle

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.400
in high office for years,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.430
forgetting that every name on the roster

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.360
is a living life.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.710
Go investigate.
Make sure it's fully uncovered.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.910
Yes.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.190
This is

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.070
the money taken

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.950
from the military supplies.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.920
Well done.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.720
When will that batch of supplies arrive?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.120
By rights, it should have arrived
two days ago.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.430
Two days ago?

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.480
Mr. Gu!

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.720
Mr. Gu,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.920
bad news.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.430
Our supply convoy was intercepted.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.510
Did you capture the culprits?

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.360
They escaped.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.310
Where are the goods?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.360
That shipment can't be exposed.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.630
One truck is missing.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.160
How could you bungle this?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.240
How could such a big shipment

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.390
be stolen?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.360
Who dares to rob my goods?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.040
Gu Tongpei.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.360
Go,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.750
call Madam and Miss down.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.240
Yes, sir.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.000
Mr. Gu,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.480
regarding the supplies,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.560
I'll think of another way.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.310
Wait.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.310
No need.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.040
We've tolerated him long enough.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.560
It's time for an end.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.000
Hello?

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.560
Hello, it's me.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.070
I've seized the military supplies

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.560
Gu Tongce used
to substitute with inferior goods.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.390
It won't be long before I dig up

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.190
all the evidence of his crimes.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.040
I worry he may harm you.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.190
I'll send people
to fetch you and Hongdou.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.600
Madam,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.800
Mr. Gu requests you and Miss Hongdou
to come downstairs.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.560
I'm busy right now.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.750
Talk later.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.630
Madam.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.680
I heard you.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.160
Just let me change my clothes.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.160
Hongdou,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.750
shall I play a game with you?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.830
Let's go.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.160
Let's play hide-and-seek now.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.190
You hide in here.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.750
No matter who comes,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.920
don't make a sound

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.160
or come out,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.360
okay?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.750
What if Father comes?

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.160
But

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.160
if it's Uncle,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.310
you can

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.920
suddenly jump out and scare him.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.480
All right?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.830
Then, the game begins.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.920
Where is Miss Hongdou?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.000
Isn't she with Tongce?

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.390
She's been gone since this morning.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.830
No idea where she went.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.120
If you're that doubtful,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.310
come in and search.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.360
I'm sorry.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.310
Please, Madam.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.830
Miss Hongdou.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.960
What's going on here?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.360
How dare you scheme
with Gu Tongpei against me?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.200
Cuff her.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.550
Yes.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.120
Stay still!

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.120
Today,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.240
I'll send you both down.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.750
Where is Hongdou?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.870
Couldn't find her.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.550
Madam said she didn't know
where Miss went.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.390
Lock down the entire mansion.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.960
It's fine if we can't find her now.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320
Just make sure she doesn't get out.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.750
Go!

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.550
Yes, sir.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.510
Tell him to come by himself.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.390
Gu Tongpei, you heard that?

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.720
Even if you've got something on me,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.960
as long as Chu Minghui and Hongdou
are in my hands,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.030
you can't do anything.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.960
What have you done to them?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.720
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.120
In person.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.320
Gu Tongce!

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.790
Calm down, it's a trap.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.320
I have to go even if it is.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.440
If anything happens to her and Hongdou,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.000
I'll regret it forever.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.120
Then I'm going with you.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.080
Gu Tongce must have other moves planned.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.550
You stay here.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.840
If anything happens to me too,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.960
you'll be the only one left to save us.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.320
With today's sudden upheaval,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.790
my chances of survival are slim.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.000
What can I do to escape?

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.200
You secretly misappropriated
military supplies?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.550
I did it under Mr. Gu's orders.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.750
It was still just for money.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.720
Too bad,

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.790
your time is almost up too.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.030
Gu Tongpei has already seized

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.960
the batch of military supplies
you tampered with.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.790
Soon, he'll dig out all the crimes

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.960
you've committed over the years.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.200
No matter whether he
or Gu Tongce survives today,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.510
all this will be reported
to those above.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.630
Based on what you know of Gu Tongce,

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.630
do you think he'll obediently confess

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.600
or

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.550
find a scapegoat?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.360
Without me, there'd be no one
to make money for him.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.030
He will keep me safe.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.120
You do think highly of yourself.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.390
What do you think he values in you?

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.720
You're just easy for him to manipulate.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.960
Speaking of worth,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.960
Commander Liu, who served
under two Military Governors,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.120
was far more valuable than you.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.390
Do you know how Gu Tongce treated him?

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.320
He stabbed him to death

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.840
without batting an eye.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.510
Wasn't he said to have been killed
by bandits while drunk

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.720
and dumped in the river?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.120
Commander Liu was a military man

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.320
with a high rank.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.790
When have there been bandits so strong

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.150
in Jiang City

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.550
that they could overpower
a city commander without resistance?

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.030
Unless it was Gu Tongce,
whom he never suspected.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.720
If you don't believe me,

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.360
you can ask him yourself.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.750
So you mean,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.550
no matter which of the brothers

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.360
wins today,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.750
I won't survive.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.910
Work with me,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.120
and I'll make sure you live.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.750
Get me the hairpin on my head.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.670
Sir!

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.320
We couldn't find Miss Hongdou.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.510
Even if you have to turn
the mansion upside down,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.750
you must find her.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.790
Yes, sir.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.030
Keep searching.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.790
I will not let anything happen to you.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.320
Pei.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.240
There you are, Tongpei.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.600
I am. Let her go.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.030
What's with the rush?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.960
Once we're finished with our business,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.000
I will.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.360
Now,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.320
drop your gun and throw it over.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.720
Don't listen to him.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.630
Don't worry about me.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.270
Leave her alone!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.910
Don't worry about me.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.480
Pei!

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.840
Stop playing the tragic lovers here,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.440
as if I'm some unforgivable villain.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:41.840
Don't forget

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.510
my whole life was ruined
by the two of you.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.510
Stay still! If you don't, I'll kill her.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.750
Are you insane, Chu Huaixuan?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.000
Believe it or not, I'll kill you

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.960
before dealing with them.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.000
Try me.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.720
See if I'll kill her faster,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.840
or if you kill me first.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.390
Can you really afford her death?

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.200
If she dies,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.120
what leverage will you have
over Gu Tongpei?

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.480
How will you get your leverage

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.750
back from him?

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.390
Chu Huaixuan, calm down.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.150
State your conditions.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.750
Neither of you, nor she,

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.550
is trustworthy.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.360
But one thing is true.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.360
She can guarantee my life.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.270
Gu Tongpei,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.750
I need you to help me
get out of Jiang City.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.480
Deal.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.390
- No!
- No.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.080
Stay still!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.750
Gu Tongce,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.120
all these years I slaved away for you,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.630
and what did it come to?

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.000
In the end,
you still cast me aside like trash.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.390
Talking about sparing my life? Ha!

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.030
I'll end up just like Commander Liu,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.440
dead in vain.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.550
You told him.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.390
I regret not stabbing you.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.750
It really was you.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.340
I don't care how you brothers fight.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.540
As long as I get out of this mansion
and leave Jiang City,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.700
do with her

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.140
whatever you like.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.100
Stay back.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.140
Or I'll shoot her dead.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.500
Minghui!

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.260
Chase him!

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.900
Don't worry about me.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.020
Do what you must.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.300
Go.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.660
Don't die on me.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.740
Why are you here?

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.460
Wu Jing worried Pei might be in danger.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.540
I hurried here

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.740
when I got his message.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.580
My people will protect you and Hongdou.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.900
Where is Hongdou?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.940
Hongdou...
