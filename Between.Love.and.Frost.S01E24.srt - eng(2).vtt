[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 24]

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.710
Hurry. Hongdou...

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.760
Pretty Lady,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.640
why are you here?

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.790
Hongdou, good girl.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.120
Come out.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.760
Mother, I've listened to you.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.480
I didn't come out on my own.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.560
It was her who found me.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.710
Good girl.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.950
Who would've thought you'd hide her

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.150
in a place like this?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.640
Thank you

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.950
for today.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.400
I didn't come here to save you.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.070
Mother,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.350
I like her too.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.840
She

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.870
is also a good person.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.560
Tongpei, I truly know I was wrong.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.710
As long as you spare me,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.960
I'll give you all of my money.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.560
I'll give the Military Governor's seat

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.520
back to you.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.960
I can leave Jiang City

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.000
and never appear again.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.590
Tongpei,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.190
we are brothers.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.360
Tongce,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.430
from the first time
you tried to assassinate me

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.190
to Father's dying moment,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.190
I've been giving you chances.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.190
It's you who failed to cherish them.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.360
Tongce,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.150
you've done
every wicked deed imaginable.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.150
No one can save you now.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.470
Useless fool! What took you so long?

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.240
Sir...

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.360
Useless wretch.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.680
Why stop here?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.960
Where did Zhao Jun arrange
for you to send me to?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.080
I had an elder brother
I relied on since childhood.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.710
For me to study properly,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.710
he chose to join the army
and endure hardship.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560
Last winter,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.070
when he was on a mission in the wild,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.120
he froze to death.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.270
When he was sent back,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.070
I found

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.800
that his winter coat
was stuffed with straw.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.430
It gave no warmth at all.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.000
That ragged coat clung to his skin.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.560
It couldn't even be torn off.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.600
You're the one who got him killed.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.920
You must apologize to him yourself.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.600
Extra!

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.270
The embezzlement case
of military supplies has come to light.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.510
Gu Tongce, the missing culprit,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.430
was found shot dead in a car.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.190
Gu Tongpei, his brother, refused
to succeed him as Military Governor.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.600
Hongdou.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Hongdou, where are you?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.750
There you were hiding.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.950
You couldn't find me, right?

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.720
Am I good?

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.750
- You are.
- You are.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.190
- Hongdou is the best.
- Hongdou is the best.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.390
Pretty Lady.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.720
Hongdou.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.800
You're really having fun.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.950
I'm leaving.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.560
I came to say goodbye.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.190
This is for you.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.390
So pretty.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.750
As pretty as you.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.800
This way,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.360
you'll have your own butterfly.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.920
Here.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.950
Thank you.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.870
Are you leaving?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.680
There's nothing to do with me now.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.190
I don't want to stay here.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.720
Chu Yan...

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.070
If you're not going to say what I want,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.000
then say nothing at all.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.720
See ya.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.360
Mother, where did Father go?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.510
Father went to a faraway place.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.160
He went to catch butterflies for you.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.270
Then

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.800
will you also

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.160
suddenly go far, far away?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.600
One day,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.070
I will also go very far away.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.720
But no matter where I go,

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.870
I'll always be thinking of you
and loving you.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.560
Come on, lie down.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.920
The noodles are ready.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.870
Try them, see if my cooking
has improved.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.720
I've resigned
from the post of Commissioner.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.120
I won't need to be
the Military Governor either.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.550
From now on,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.550
I'll have plenty of time
to spend with you and Hongdou.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.630
We'll go abroad,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.600
traveling around

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.270
while seeking doctors for your illness.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.960
If we find a place we like,
we'll live there for a few years.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.960
When we tire of it,
we'll move somewhere else.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.870
Seems you've hidden away
quite some savings.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.510
Just how much exactly?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.780
Is it enough to live on?

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.740
If not, I'll just earn more.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.500
Even if I have to work as a laborer,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.300
I will not let you two suffer.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.820
If you don't answer,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.540
I'll take it as a yes.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.500
I love you.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.980
Every moment from now on,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.780
I will be loving you.

You can pass.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.780
Slow down.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.340
The ticket, please.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.780
[Flowers never fade, the moon shines
eternal, two hearts beat as one]

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.340
Take a nap if you don't feel well.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.940
I'll wake you when we arrive.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.780
I want to hear you talk to me.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.020
Okay.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.820
The first stop we're going to is

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.380
a city where it's warm all year round.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.180
I came across that city by chance.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.700
The whole city is in bloom with flowers,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.140
and there are many handicrafts
made of flowers.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.940
We've known each other for so long,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.340
and I've never properly
given you flowers.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.620
When we are there,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.100
I'll plant you a whole sea of flowers.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.220
What flowers do you like?

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.740
Roses or lilies?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.580
Roses.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.620
l like red ones.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.300
I like red roses too.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.420
They're just like you.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.580
Passionate and romantic.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.980
We can take Hongdou
to join us in planting.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.580
When the flowers bloom,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.140
you'll see an endless ocean of flowers

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.980
every morning when you wake up.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.700
Okay.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.860
We can also make

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.580
flower cakes.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.140
And sell them.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.780
You really do know how to live.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.180
What about the second stop?

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.420
Where will we go?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.180
The second stop

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.580
is a little harbor town.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.100
It's beautiful in a different way.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.740
When we go there,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.980
you'll be greeted
by a boundless sea view

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.380
every morning you wake up.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.300
You can take Hongdou

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.620
to feel the sea breeze

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.820
and collect seashells on the beach

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.420
while I go fishing.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.260
Hongdou is still little.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.220
She can't swim yet.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.300
We'll need to

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.060
watch out for her.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.140
She's so smart.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.700
She'll learn as soon as she tries.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.260
We'll teach her together.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.060
Okay.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.060
And then,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.460
we'll set out from the harbor

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.540
and take a cruise ship abroad.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.020
You haven't tried it, have you?

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.700
From the deck,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.420
we'll watch the sun slowly rise
above the horizon,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.260
the water sparkling and glistening.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.700
And when night falls,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.740
we'll stand on deck
and gaze at the moon.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.500
The moon will seem

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.940
almost close enough to touch.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.660
The stars will be dazzling.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.700
With the waves as our lullaby,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.620
we'll slowly sail
into the next destination

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.140
and begin our new life.
