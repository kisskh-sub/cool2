00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.600
City Lord, do you recognize this?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.720
Lingxiang Herb?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.800
It only grows in Mobei.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.639
Why is it here?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600
We found it in a batch

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.800
of Madam Hong's shipment.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.400
It was carefully concealed.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.720
This is the raw material
for Yunluo Incense.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.560
I've heard it causes severe poisoning.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520
On the way of my parents to the capital,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.880
they were ambushed by Mobei assassins.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.480
And this herb was also found
at the scene.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.800
That trip to the capital

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.160
to destroy the sacred artifact?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.280
Remember.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.200
Never mention this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.840
in the City Lord's Mansion again.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880
Everything that happened
was by chance and coincidence.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.800
No one could have known it.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.312
Yes.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.320
(So Yunqing's parents died)

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(because of me?)

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.872
City Lord.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.200
There's something

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.480
I wonder if I tell you.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.440
Why the hesitation?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.672
Say it.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.560
After the physician treated Mr. Yunhao,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.728
and I escorted him out.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.440
He said something strange.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.832
Strange?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.720
The physician said

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.120
Mr. Yunhao's wound

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.000
seems to be stabbed

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.400
by himself.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:26.656
Are you okay?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.016
Wan.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.880
What did you want to tell me?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.920
Nothing. Let's talk another day.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.560
I'm tired now,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.496
and need rest.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.920
Alright. Get some sleep.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.600
(Mu Yunqing, I'm sorry.)

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.620
(Yu's Courier)

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.720
Godmother, have some tea.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.400
Godmother, have you heard of

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.040
a plant called Lingxiang Herb?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.960
I heard it's from Mobei.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.240
Have you ever seen it?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600
Never.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.160
Wan, this is my first visit here.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.840
You've arranged it nicely.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.520
Of course!

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.680
Welcome to visit often,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.960
Godmother.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720
I thought after Mu Yunqing died,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.880
you'd marry Qiming.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.400
Didn't expect

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.960
he's just putting on an act.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.080
About his fake death,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.760
I only learned afterward.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.720
I wrongly accused Mr. Song before.

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:25.480
Sorry, Godmother.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.520
It's my fault.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.600
My son

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.480
would never do such a thing.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.040
You're right, Godmother.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.120
(Yu's Courier)

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.160
Wan, what's wrong?
Worried about something?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.720
Be careful.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.040
All are Madam's favorites.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.280
City Lord, you're acting strange today.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.480
It's Madam who usually handles these.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840
None of your concern.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.920
You're not married yet.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.240
You know nothing.

00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:08.960
This is what married life looks like.

00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:12.600
Grandfather.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600
Yunqing,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000
put a swing there.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.200
The children will love it.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.280
Over here,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.560
plant two trees

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.800
to bless the Mu family's safety.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.440
Place two fish tanks here

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.560
with some goldfish.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.880
Seeing them swimming around.
How delightful!

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.880
Alright, Grandfather.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.416
But

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.560
I should check with Wan first.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.320
If she agrees,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.320
you can arrange whatever you want.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.520
You!

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.080
I'm doing this for you.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.320
I'm teaching you

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.560
how to build a proper home.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.600
Grandfather,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.760
I'll go fetch Wan.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.440
Yunhao, have you recovered?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.648
Much better.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.640
Yunhao.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.360
Feeling better now?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.968
Yes.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.632
Grandfather,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.080
I want to stay in the villa for a while,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.280
return after recovering.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.480
Go ahead.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.600
That place
is suitable for convalescence.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.960
Yunhao, are you really going?

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.000
Perhaps I'll send someone
to accompany you.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.840
No need. You're busy with work.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.040
I won't trouble you.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.600
I can go there by myself.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.392
I'll take my leave, Grandfather.

00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:29.480
Go and recover properly.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.072
Alright.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.800
(We're all in the Mu family.)

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.520
(Why must I always be
a supporting character?)

00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:43.800
Have some tea.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.760
Thank you.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.520
Miss Yu, try this.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.760
Thank you, Mr. Song.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.744
City Lord.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.240
If you are available,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.280
could you come with me?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.944
Alright.

00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:12.320
(Shili Pavilion)

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:29.040
(This Mr. Song looks)

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.160
(somewhat familiar.)

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:34.464
(Spirit Tablet of Song Zhao)

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.559
I brought him to see you.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.840
City Lord, do you remember who he is?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.720
Look closely.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.360
He was my husband, Song Zhao.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.160
He was also
your father's deputy general.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.120
Mr. Song?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.520
Yunqing, you must hide well.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.824
Don't come out.

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.256
After them!

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.200
Though many years have passed,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.600
I wasn't even four years old then.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.240
I don't clearly remember
Mr. Song's appearance,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.760
but I'll never forget

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.080
his life-saving grace.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.360
You still remember all this?

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.960
But do you know

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.840
how we've struggled

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.080
through these years?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.320
Madam, I'm sorry.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.240
If not for saving you,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.280
our family of four

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.360
could have lived happily and peacefully,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.800
nor would we have lost
my daughter Baozhu.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.880
I didn't want to forgive you.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.920
But today,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.240
Wan told me something.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.400
Only then did I realize the truth.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.200
Recently,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.160
I think of things from my childhood.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.960
Never thought a childhood mistake

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.720
could cause such disaster.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.120
This makes me feel guilty every day.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.720
Grandfather knew it was my fault,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.680
yet chose not to hate me,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.320
instead, kept cherishing me,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.080
and kept me by their side

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.920
to protect me.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.920
They only regard Mobei as the enemy,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.160
and never blame me at all.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.440
I can't accept

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.160
that all this is my fault.

00:11:26.464 --> 00:11:27.584
(Indeed.)

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.920
(My husband was killed tragically)

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.400
(by Mobei assassins.)

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.320
(How could I blame)

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.920
(a child who wasn't even four?)

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.280
Rather than hating you,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.800
I hate those Mobei people more.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.000
They poisoned my husband,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.880
and made me lose my daughter.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.920
I will no longer hate you.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.080
From today on,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.200
I will live well

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.880
to live up to those who passed away.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.320
Madam Hong.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.480
May I offer incense to Mr. Song?

00:12:30.707 --> 00:12:31.616
(Spirit Tablet of Song Zhao)

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.440
Mr. Song,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.640
thank you for saving my life.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.640
From now on,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.080
I'll treat Qiming

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.840
as my own younger brother

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.960
and care for Madam Hong.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.040
Rest assured.

00:13:13.248 --> 00:13:16.240
Please accept my three bows.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.640
Dear, can you hear it?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.040
Your desperate rescue
of the City Lord wasn't in vain.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.416
Madam Hong.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120
Madam Hong.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.680
Thank you for telling me about Wan.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.920
It's troubled me for so long.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.320
About your father and mother,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.800
I hope you can tell Wan properly.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.120
Don't let her blame herself anymore.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.624
Alright.
