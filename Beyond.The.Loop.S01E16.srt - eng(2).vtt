00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.240
Wan, you've been preoccupied lately.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.584
Is it because of
what happened back then?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960
Why didn't you tell me

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.120
all these years?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.480
What happened

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.520
isn't anyone's fault.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.720
It's not your fault.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.400
Wan.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.400
Do you remember?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.840
When we were kids,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.360
what my father used to say?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.320
Keep moving forward?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.240
Our current life didn't come easily.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.336
From now on,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.040
we must stay together

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.040
and face challenges.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's follow his advice.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.280
Keep moving forward. Okay?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.760
Yunqing.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.120
The reason I can't let go

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.320
isn't just that they're your parents.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.400
They're also our baby's grandparents.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080
Really?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Such wonderful news!

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.240
If my parents knew,

00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:49.320
they'd be overjoyed.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.120
Wan, trust me.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.840
I'll protect you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.480
and our child.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.360
The family of us three

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200
will grow happier every day.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.120
Mother and Father would be proud too.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.040
Trust me.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.216
I do.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.400
In the future,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.120
we'll go through

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440
thick and thin together.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.560
Let the bygones

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480
be bygones.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.960
Stop dwelling on it.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.152
Okay?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.808
Okay.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.280
Yunqing, I want to thank someone.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.720
City Lord.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.160
Why call me out so late at night?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.992
Make a guess.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.160
If Mother finds out about this...

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.240
Miss Yu, you...

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.280
Mr. Song.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.120
I misunderstood you before.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.560
I apologize.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.920
But thank you for saving Yunqing.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.536
Qiming.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.520
I haven't thanked you yet.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.832
Thank you.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.800
I should do so.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.480
And I wasn't mad at you.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.080
Then are we still friends?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.424
Of course.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.160
Don't mess with me.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.600
You are so fierce.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.720
What can you do to me?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.880
You'll still dote on me.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.368
Stop.

00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:40.080
What's wrong?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.160
No.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.000
Why?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.640
It is the price I should pay.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.400
Never seen you act like this before.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.520
Come here.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.624
No! I want to be a good father!

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:55.560
Just one hug?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.680
No. Don't touch me.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.480
Hug me!

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.392
No.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.280
You don't love me anymore?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.160
No.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.584
No.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.160
Let me hug you.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.160
Good night.

00:07:29.952 --> 00:07:30.920
You're Mu Yunhao

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.960
who wants
to be the City Lord of Jin City?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.320
You're Mu Yunqing's elder brother.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.240
You turned against your brother?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840
I don't want

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.600
to keep working with a guy like you.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.440
Just give me the Lingxiang Herb,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.320
and I'll help you conquer Jin City.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.320
Jin City's thirty thousand troops

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.240
will help your take the Central Plains.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.760
Lingxiang Herb?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.040
I swear

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.720
this time I can kill Mu Yunqing

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880
and his wife.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.520
Once they're gone,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.760
the City Lord Token will be mine

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.120
sooner or later.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.720
My patience has limits.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.320
This is your final chance.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.176
If you don't get the City Lord Token,

00:08:22.496 --> 00:08:23.904
I'll make you suffer terribly.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.880
I love money. Money loves me.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.720
I'll earn much of it.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.896
Here.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.920
Deliver this to the Li family
at the eastern city gate.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.928
Make it quick.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.680
Delicious pastries.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.840
Where did you get them?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.600
Your friend sent them.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.808
Which friend?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.440
I think the name with Luo...

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.240
Someone I met in the mansion.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
Luo Shishi?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.120
My lady.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.040
Help!

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.640
Physician, how's my wife?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720
Madam has been poisoned.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.680
As for whether
it's Lingxiang Herb poison,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.240
I am not able to confirm that.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.880
I think a physician

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.880
who served for the military
on the frontier

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.920
might be able to confirm it.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.160
Fortunately, she didn't eat much.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.080
I'll prescribe antidotal herbs

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.600
to alleviate her symptoms.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.000
The unborn child remains safe for now.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.280
However,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.800
she must take good rest.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.040
Wei Feng, issue an order!

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.560
Arrest Luo Shishi.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.000
Yes, City Lord.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880
Escort him back.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.680
Sir, this way please.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.752
Okay.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.216
It's okay.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.840
Liu Bingmo, take good care of Madam.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.000
I'll search for a physician
familiar with Lingxiang Herb poison.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.400
Yes, City Lord.

00:11:01.344 --> 00:11:02.480
You...

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.400
Come with me.

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:07.880
(Miraculous Cure, Renxin Clinic)
Easy now, easy.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.776
Sir, what's your opinion?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.760
Never thought I'd encounter

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.560
a Lingxiang Herb poison case again.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.200
Can you treat this poison?

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.080
I'll do my best.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.280
Come with me to prepare the antidote.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.240
Okay, I'll go with you.

00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:37.640
During military services,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.440
did you encounter similar poison cases?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960
Just one case.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.280
When I served for the military,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.360
a deputy general got poisoned by this.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.680
But my medical skills

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.000
couldn't save his life.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.560
Was the deputy general

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.720
Mr. Song from my father's army?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.320
Yes, exactly.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.360
Madam, perhaps you should rest inside.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.040
You might catch a cold here.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.400
I'm fine.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.000
The baby says he wants some sunshine.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.600
Careful.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.800
Alright.

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:30.000
Baby.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.600
I will definitely protect you.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.040
Wan, why aren't you
resting at the mansion?

00:12:58.432 --> 00:12:59.440
I'm doing the accounts.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.088
- Haven't finished it yet.
- You...

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.120
Godmother.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.960
Wan.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.520
Godmother, what brings you here?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.080
I went to the City Lord's Mansion

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.880
and they said you were here.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.920
Wan, are you alright?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.480
Much better now.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.360
Just like before.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.320
Some matters delayed me these past days.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.040
I should've come sooner.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.880
Don't worry about me.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.864
I'll recover.

00:13:28.864 --> 00:13:29.760
I'm perfectly fine.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.656
Glad to hear that.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.448
Madam Hong.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.760
There's something I want to ask.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.600
And I hope you can answer me.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.240
Is it about the Lingxiang Herb?

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.440
Wan asked me about it before.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.800
I knew

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.720
she learned about it from you.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.560
But I wasn't ready
to share this with you.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.360
Godmother, are you truly
growing the Lingxiang Herb?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.680
I am indeed growing the Lingxiang Herb,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.560
but I would never harm you.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.200
I do it with my own reasons.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.240
As for what,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.600
I can't tell you yet.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.776
Madam Hong.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.400
Growing the Lingxiang Herb is dangerous.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.040
No one can cure this poison now.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.720
Please stop now.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.200
I appreciate your kindness,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.280
but I must grow the Lingxiang Herb.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.920
I have something that I must do,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.400
otherwise, I would regret it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.800
If you don't mind,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.680
I'll take my leave.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640
Madam Hong, hold on.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.560
What I just said

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.880
wasn't only for your sake,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.160
but also for your daughter's.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.280
My daughter?

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.880
It's a sad story.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.000
Mr. Song once had a happy family,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.040
with a son and a daughter.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.920
But on the night he died,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.680
his daughter went missing.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.320
On that very day?

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.280
Remember any features of his daughter?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.680
His wife posted notices.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.880
I remember

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.480
that girl had a birthmark.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.920
A pale pink birthmark

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.560
on her waist.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.160
Your daughter had
a birthmark on her left waist.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.720
She was lost in Anle Alley years ago,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.120
right?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.160
How do you know this?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.040
Wan is your biological daughter.
