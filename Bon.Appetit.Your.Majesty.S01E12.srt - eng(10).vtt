BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.926
Who goes there?

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:07.817
Is this a revolt?

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.569
What about His Majesty?

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.321
What happened to him?

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.239
{\an8}YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.743
Your Majesty,
you must get out of here immediately!

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.828
Your Majesty!

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:38.973
Who are you?

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:42.018
Can you not tell? We are jesters!

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:43.520
Drop your sword!

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.862
Cook Yeon, we must go right now.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:14.676
Cook Yeon.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.762
You, above all, must be safe.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.025
{\an8}The purge hasn't even happened.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.027
{\an8}What's happening?

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.865
{\an8}Tell me, Gong-gil.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.742
{\an8}I saw the guards wearing red headbands.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:41.703
{\an8}Is this…

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.538
{\an8}It is treason.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:45.415
{\an8}Treason?

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.376
{\an8}Who's leading it?

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.296
{\an8}Grand Prince Jesan and his followers.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.923
{\an8}They already killed Im Seo-hong,
the Second Minister of Works.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.925
{\an8}They were targeting you next.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.302
{\an8}That is why I hurriedly got you out.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.761
{\an8}Me?

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.390
{\an8}What about His Majesty? Where is he?

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:04.517
I do not know yet.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.478
The best you can do now is hide.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.230
What are you saying?

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.857
I must see His Majesty right now.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.319
Did you not hear me say
they are after you?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.030
Are you that worried about him?

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.656
Yes.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.617
I guess you're not.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.079
What if you go back and they capture you?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.665
Do you not see it?

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.209
You must stay alive.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.878
That is the way to help His Majesty.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.513
His Majesty tried so hard
to restrain himself.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.225
How could this happen?

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.614
It is rather odd that Her Royal Highness
summoned us at this hour.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:02.909
Do you think
she heard about our gathering?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.580
{\an8}I believe she has finally
made up her mind.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.291
{\an8}She did witness
His Majesty's madness unleash after all.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.835
We will see soon enough.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.420
Let us hurry.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:15.421
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.722
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.100
And for what reason
are you holding a sword?

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.144
I am here to uphold a royal command.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.021
A royal command?

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.106
The command

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.318
to eliminate the treacherous
Han family, who, reveled in power,

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.656
manipulated the nation from the shadows.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.408
Then it was not

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.495
Her Royal Highness who summoned us?

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:50.957
How dare you!

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.334
Do you not fear the heavens?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.544
The heavens?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.589
The heavens, you say?

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.601
Do not worry.

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:14.230
For your death will go down as the doing

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.358
of the current king, the tyrant.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.901
What?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.205
Do not shut the gate!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.207
May you rest in peace.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.381
- No!
- Do not shut the gate! Let us out!

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.177
Mother, I am so afraid.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.553
It is all right.

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:46.721
{\an8}It will be all right.

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:48.014
{\an8}GRAND PRINCE JINMYEONG
YI HEON'S HALF BROTHER

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.307
{\an8}QUEEN DOWAGER JAHYEON
YI HEON'S STEPMOTHER

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.207
Grand Prince Jesan.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.758
Your Royal Highness.

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.385
A disaster has befallen us.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.597
That is why I came to you in haste.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.015
What is this disaster you speak of?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.767
Brace yourself for the news.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.852
His Majesty lost his mind

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.688
and murdered the Grand Royal Queen Dowager

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:41.150
and slaughtered
all the court officials indiscriminately.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:42.568
Then

00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:45.113
are you saying Her Royal Highness…

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.116
{\an8}has passed away?

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.119
{\an8}I reached her too late.

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:55.206
And so I hurriedly gathered
the officials of the Sarim faction

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.376
and entered the palace,
risking discourtesy,

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:01.921
to protect Your Royal Highness
and Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:05.424
Then where is His Majesty right now?

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:09.053
He went to Salgoji Forest
to battle the rebel forces

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:13.724
who rose to hold him responsible
for his madness.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.226
Battle, you say?

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:18.896
Mother.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.065
Are you all right?

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.525
Mother.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.526
Jinmyeong.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.736
What should we do now?

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:28.114
Your Royal Highness.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:29.198
It is time

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.454
for Grand Prince Jinmyeong
to ascend the throne.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.876
What did you just say?

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.880
How could you say such a thing
when His Majesty is still alive?

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:48.551
{\an8}Are you saying you want my Jinmyeong
to become a rebel leader?

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.719
Do you truly…

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.473
not see

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:55.600
who the tyrant's blade…

00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.521
will come for next?

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:05.276
Before His Majesty becomes a threat
to you and Grand Prince Jinmyeong,

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:07.195
he must be dethroned.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.197
Even so…

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.452
Jinmyeong is still too young.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.218
Must we…

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.346
shed even more blood

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.516
for you to listen to me?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.607
Three days.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.610
Give me three days
to contemplate the matter.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.153
Her Royal Highness' funeral--

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.363
I cannot.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.616
The throne must not be left vacant
for even one day.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.203
{\an8}The coronation will be held
as soon as dawn breaks tomorrow.

00:08:58.162 --> 00:08:59.163
{\an8}That is final.

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:03.668
What if His Majesty were to return?

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.379
How will you handle the consequences?

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:08.923
This time…

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:13.302
it will be almost impossible

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.805
for him to return alive.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.613
Your Majesty.

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.410
Your Majesty…

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:48.296
Your Majesty.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.176
Your Majesty!

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:57.638
Your Majesty!

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:03.894
COURSE N° 12 HWANSEBAN

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.783
Your Royal Highness.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:21.704
A calamity has struck the palace,
so we brought the royal seal to you.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.456
Bring it forth.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.756
{\an8}This was sent from Sangseowon,
Office of the Royal Seal.

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:35.217
{\an8}We request your wise counsel,
Your Royal Highness.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:46.062
{\an8}Inform the Ministry of Rites
that Her Royal Highness

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.856
{\an8}will do what is right to honor
the royal ancestors and the state,

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:51.901
uphold order within the court,
and calm the disarray.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.861
The coronation for the new king

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:55.655
will be held soon,

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.282
{\an8}so instruct all officials
to prepare to show their respect.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:10:59.909
{\an8}Yes, Your Highness.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.585
{\an8}Please issue the royal edict.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.795
{\an8}ROYAL EDICT: OFFICIAL DOCUMENT
CONTAINING THE KING'S COMMAND

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.389
Very well.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.517
I will write the edict.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:29.355
However, it will not simply include
the matter of the coronation,

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.777
but also a pledge for a new era.

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.904
I understand.

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.785
I, too, will take part in presenting

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:46.914
a new world to our people

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:53.629
alongside Grand Prince Jinmyeong,
who will soon ascend the throne.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:08.102
Have you heard?

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:10.312
The king lost his mind last night,

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.189
murdered his own grandmother,

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.150
and indiscriminately slaughtered
the court officials.

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.026
And after committing such a heinous act,

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.320
- he left to hunt!
- How ridiculous!

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.990
The current king will be dethroned,
and a new king will ascend the throne.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.116
Who will be the new king?

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:23.367
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.536
He will soon ascend the throne.

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:28.831
Word is that the king died
in a hunting accident.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.459
- The king has passed? Is that true?
- Yes.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:32.960
I heard he was burned to death.

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:35.588
- He was punished by the heavens.
- Indeed.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:40.092
{\an8}CORONATION

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:48.309
Our nation has been cultivating virtue
for one hundred years,

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:51.145
and by doing so,
it has let down strong and healthy roots.

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:55.691
Unfortunately,
our current king neglected his duties,

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:59.153
crushing the people's trust
and plunging them into distress.

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:02.740
- For the sake of our nation…
- …and its people,

00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:05.159
by the mandate of the heavens,

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:08.370
Grand Prince Jinmyeong
will be appointed as the new king

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:11.290
and shall ascend the throne
as the 11th King of Joseon.

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:13.709
As the new king,

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:19.173
may he rule wisely
and save his people from their concerns.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.885
Long live the king.

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:26.514
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:30.059
{\an8}- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.479
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.501
The reign of the tyrant is over at last.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.797
Congratulations.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.051
Your efforts for this very day

00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:06.345
have finally paid off.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.432
I owe this glory to you all

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.351
who have assisted me throughout.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:17.648
Soon, the people will offer you
their support and favor.

00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.359
You should ascend the throne then.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.071
And become a sage king for us all.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.949
- Become a sage king for us.
- Become a sage king for us.

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.413
My goodness.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.959
It has been less than half a day

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.712
since our new king ascended the throne.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.298
Save your breath.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.886
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:50.931
What happened to His Majesty
after he went to Salgoji Forest?

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:53.309
They say there were no survivors,

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:54.268
so it seems

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.229
no one has made it through last night.

00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:01.275
I find it odd

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.945
that the chief royal cook
found out and got away.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.157
Do not worry.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.117
With His Majesty gone from the palace,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.911
the chief royal cook's life

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:13.662
is at its close.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.000
That's impossible.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.754
His Majesty had agreed to eat
with the Grand Royal Queen Dowager.

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:24.214
So why would he harm her?

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.633
Or his subjects?

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.844
A new king ascended the throne overnight.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.471
There is nothing we can do now.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.810
If Grand Prince Jinmyeong
ascended the throne,

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:39.939
what's going to happen to His Majesty?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.693
Upon hearing you were taken
by a band of rebels,

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.654
he went to Salgoji Forest,

00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:48.739
and he has not been seen since.

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:52.534
He went all the way there because of me?

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:56.705
They say there were piles of dead bodies

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.832
at Salgoji Forest.

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:01.502
No one has found his body yet,

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.963
but it is unlikely he survived.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:07.883
It can't be.

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:11.512
I shall go out and see
if I can get more news.

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:14.473
Wait here until I get back.

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:16.684
Wait.

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:22.940
Take this.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.446
Please find His Majesty
and give this to him.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:31.532
Tell him I'm safe.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.660
I shall.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.628
Court Lady Kim…

00:16:45.754 --> 00:16:47.965
{\an8}I cannot believe you died
such a futile death.

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:52.052
I do not understand what is happening.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.263
{\an8}How can everything change overnight?

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.890
{\an8}I hope our chief royal cook
is somewhere safe.

00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.018
It worries me that she just vanished.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.394
It worries me too.

00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:02.563
She left without a word to me.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.818
If she returned to the future
that she said she came from,

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.320
I would not be so worried.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:13.115
What are you talking about?

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.617
Our chief royal cook came from the future?

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.078
- Well…
- Are you all right, Maid Seo?

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.621
Are you not feeling well?

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.290
- No, it is--
- There is already enough madness

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:23.500
in the palace as it is.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.462
- Get a hold of yourself.
- This is so frustrating!

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.589
Why can you not believe me?

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:32.176
This is why
she did not tell any of you about it.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:35.596
Miss…

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:39.266
Is it true that His Majesty lost his mind

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:42.311
and plunged the palace into chaos?

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:45.481
He did have fits,
but nothing like this has ever happened.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.649
I find it hard to believe.

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.987
How have you all been?

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.421
Your Majesty.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.800
Where are you?

00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:16.136
Who are you?

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.138
Are you Korean?

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:19.890
Could she be a gwinyeo?

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.016
No, stop it.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.018
Halt!

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:27.189
I command that she be immediately

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:29.274
appointed as the chief royal cook!

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:33.821
Now that I've survived
the harrowing, difficult times…

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.115
A true cook

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:39.034
does not blame the lack of time,
but selects good ingredients

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.120
to create an exquisite dish.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.580
…I realize

00:18:44.164 --> 00:18:47.501
that you always made me
want to become a better chef.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:51.421
I do not wish to eat anything tonight.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.633
Now, if you're not there to eat my food,

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.719
I have no reason to cook.

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.264
Promise me…

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:02.975
that you will never
let yourself get hurt again.

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:10.023
I can finally be honest with my feelings.

00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:13.986
I miss you…

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.238
Your Majesty.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.130
It is an ambush!

00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:41.513
{\an8}Are you saying
you lost the dethroned king?

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.933
If what he says is true,
is this not a disaster, Your Highness?

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.437
I apologize, Your Highness.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.065
I will bring you his head
within three days.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.360
Leave it.

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:59.448
A tiger that has lost its territory

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:03.035
can do nothing but roar out in rage.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.579
Lord Yoo.

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:07.080
You may enter.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.253
The remnants of Urimwi
ambushed the North Gate.

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.171
What?

00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:16.673
Urimwi launched an ambush?

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:17.674
What should we do?

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.886
We have a new king,
so this stands as an act of treason.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.433
What more can a dethroned king

00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:28.393
who is on the run do?

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.480
Your Highness!

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.482
We urgently request your presence.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:52.042
Why must it be so hard
to enter my own home?

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.304
Consort Kang,
I truly hoped you were not one of them.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:07.766
I thought you harmed Jinmyeong
only out of jealousy toward my cook.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.646
I see the hands that used to console me…

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.901
were hiding a blade.

00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:23.031
I waited for this day to come
from the very beginning.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:26.994
I will not seek
your understanding or forgiveness.

00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:36.670
Yes. That is what I expect of you.

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.047
But do not forget this.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.675
One who bears a sword with a grin…

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.971
will eventually be struck by it.

00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:54.187
Uncle.

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.481
You are back, Your Majesty.

00:21:58.775 --> 00:21:59.776
Yes.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:01.862
I am back alive.

00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:04.948
We must have one final conversation.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:25.719
I see the preparations at Salgoji Forest
were not sufficient.

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.598
They were more than sufficient.

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:31.558
However,

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.935
you chose the wrong ground for the battle.

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:37.647
You wanted the people to think

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:41.777
the tyrannical king who killed his own kin
went hunting in Salgoji Forest,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.071
where he was punished by the heavens.

00:22:44.654 --> 00:22:46.490
Is that not right?

00:22:47.282 --> 00:22:48.241
However,

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:51.369
you overlooked the fact that
I am familiar with the terrain there.

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:57.626
Now I see why my men lost you.

00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:02.089
So, did you leave for the forest
fully aware of the disaster

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:04.674
that would befall the palace?

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:08.804
Were you also aware I was behind the plot?

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:11.973
I realized
right before I left for the forest.

00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:15.685
I just was not certain.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:18.563
Do explain how.

00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:26.071
"The edges of objects
are always harder to see,

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.741
and when you sleep,
be sure to lock the latch securely."

00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:30.826
That was the message.

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:33.328
{\an8}It is a riddle based on
the sounds of characters.

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:36.123
{\an8}Did Tang Bailong
try to send me a message with a riddle?

00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:38.166
Je for "edge."

00:23:39.126 --> 00:23:41.336
San for "latch."

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:42.462
JESAN

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:50.428
I see the Ming cook
has spoken out of turn.

00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:53.098
Either way, you lost.

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:54.891
Do you not agree?

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:57.435
It must be retribution
for the Muin Literati Purge.

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:01.857
Then are you prepared to accept

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:04.734
whatever punishment is given to you?

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:06.403
I have already been dethroned.

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:10.615
What more do you want from me?

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:15.412
You resented your grandmother
and her Han family so much,

00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:16.454
and it was I

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:21.084
who killed them on your behalf,
was it not?

00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:25.463
Now,

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:30.719
it is time for you
to take full responsibility.

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.849
It is true
that I once wanted them all dead.

00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:38.518
However, I was going to reconcile
with my grandmother.

00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:39.561
What if you did?

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.313
What would that have changed?

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:45.525
What about the lives
of the loyal subjects you killed

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.152
during the Muin Literati Purge?

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:54.576
What about the officials you took down
using chaehong,

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:56.036
led by the Chief Royal Secretary,

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.830
under the guise of avenging
the deposed queen?

00:24:59.414 --> 00:25:00.624
Have you forgotten

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.919
all that happened in those days?

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:06.004
Have you forgotten
the pain and suffering you caused?

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:16.097
It is all my fault.

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.894
I have absolutely no excuse…

00:25:23.563 --> 00:25:25.190
for what happened.

00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:29.736
Now you show remorse?

00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:32.989
What more must I do

00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:36.618
to absolve myself of my sins?

00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:38.870
Though I am not sure

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:42.249
if I can be absolved of them at all.

00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:44.751
The very thought of them…

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.047
torments me greatly as well.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.173
That is why

00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:53.343
I returned everything to order
with a revolt.

00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:55.053
Your mother's tragedy.

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:57.305
Your late father
and the Han family's mistake

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.932
of putting you on the throne!

00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:00.016
You!

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.893
You should never have been king.

00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:03.270
It should have been me!

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:05.605
The throne should have been mine!

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.573
So that is what this was all about?

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.869
I see you wanted to be king, Uncle.

00:26:21.037 --> 00:26:22.247
I have one question.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.082
Why did you return to the palace?

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:25.125
There was

00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.712
no place for me
to hide on this land anyway,

00:26:28.795 --> 00:26:31.256
so I wanted to settle things with you
once and for all.

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:32.215
Very well.

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:33.842
Tell me.

00:26:34.384 --> 00:26:35.218
What do you want?

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.932
I want your word
that you will uphold Jinmyeong's reign,

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:44.477
so he does not make the mistakes I did.

00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:49.024
Then I will take full responsibility
and accept my dethronement.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.901
I am prepared to do so.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.113
What a just ruler you are.

00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:57.449
Very well.

00:26:57.532 --> 00:27:01.453
I will banish you
to where your mother is buried.

00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:02.996
Very well.

00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:07.208
If shouldering the weight of it all

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.544
is the way to atone for my sins.

00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:18.136
Just as I thought,
I cannot leave you be, Uncle.

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:20.513
I may be a living criminal,

00:27:23.183 --> 00:27:24.434
but you are

00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:26.853
a true tyrant possessed by madness.

00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:31.024
You sure have changed a great deal

00:27:31.107 --> 00:27:33.777
after meeting the chief royal cook,
Your Majesty.

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.745
Here is the journal you asked for.

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:46.414
You will never eat such dishes again,

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:49.834
so consider this His Highness' mercy,
allowing you to keep your memory.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.972
MANGUNROK

00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:10.688
Cook Yeon.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.525
Are you still alive?

00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:23.076
The chief royal cook
greatly misses the hometown

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.911
she left behind.

00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:28.164
How does "hwanseban," meaning
"food that brings one home," sound?

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:29.749
HWANSEBAN

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:34.504
My dearly beloved,

00:28:35.588 --> 00:28:36.631
if…

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.592
you were to read this someday,

00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:42.470
may you come back

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.014
{\an8}to my side.

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.518
MANGUNROK

00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:50.019
For then,

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.272
I will recognize you

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.275
at first glance.

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:57.944
For then,

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.655
my heart shall belong to you
from the very beginning.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:16.504
You are alive,

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:20.383
Cook Yeon.

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.471
That is a great relief.

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.850
His Majesty is really alive?

00:29:29.809 --> 00:29:31.227
The situation is not ideal,

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:32.937
but he is alive.

00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:35.940
I gave him the butterfly ornament,

00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:38.985
so he will know you are alive.

00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:40.069
Then…

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:45.867
will His Majesty be exiled now?

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.620
How do you know that?

00:29:49.662 --> 00:29:51.372
{\an8}I heard he will be banished.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:52.499
{\an8}BANISH: TO SEND A CRIMINAL FAR AWAY
AS PUNISHMENT

00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:54.667
{\an8}The events are unfolding
just as they did in history,

00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:56.711
even though
he didn't even initiate a purge.

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:58.463
At this rate,

00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:00.924
he'll die shortly after being exiled.

00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:03.510
I heard you came from the future.

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:08.890
Do you know what happens
after he is exiled?

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.725
The records say

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.144
he died shortly afterward.

00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:15.438
I see.

00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:18.107
It may seem like they are showing mercy,

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:20.109
but who knows what will happen to him

00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:21.778
once he is banished?

00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:23.822
Gong-gil.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:25.949
We must save His Majesty, no matter what.

00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:27.659
Will you please help me?

00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:36.209
That damned man.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.297
- He should be beheaded.
- Indeed.

00:30:43.883 --> 00:30:45.134
Though the criminal Yi Heon

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.137
ascended the throne
by the mandate of the heavens,

00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:50.473
not only did he neglect his duties,

00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:54.185
but he also persecuted
and executed his subjects without cause.

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:55.603
As if that were not enough,

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.814
he committed the heinous impiety

00:30:57.897 --> 00:31:00.066
of murdering
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager,

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:03.820
and just one day after his dethronement,
he committed treason.

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:06.823
Thus, he is hereby demoted
to the status of a prince as Yeonhuigun

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:10.118
and sentenced to exile in Ganghwa.

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.203
I remember.

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.413
Yeonhuigun.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.914
You don't know the tyrant Yeonhuigun?

00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:16.207
The worst tyrant of Joseon.

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:20.336
How did you know I would like this dish?

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.380
I studied Yeonhuigun.

00:31:22.463 --> 00:31:24.674
I'm from the future.

00:31:26.467 --> 00:31:27.552
Yeonhuigun.

00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:31.431
That was me.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:34.392
Cook Yeon.

00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:36.477
I see now

00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:40.523
that you recognized me
from the very beginning.

00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:53.411
You do not look so content.

00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:56.956
It would be crazy of me
to laugh in this situation.

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:02.420
Does that mean I am crazy?

00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:09.427
Your Highness, it is finally over.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.803
Congratulations.

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:13.389
A fire is not fully extinguished

00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:16.017
until the last embers are put out.

00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:18.561
We still have something to take care of.

00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:20.063
Do you mean…

00:32:20.146 --> 00:32:22.357
The thought of sparing his life
weighed on my mind.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.484
You are truly very wise.

00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:26.903
Lords Sung and Kim,
please remain in the palace

00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:28.780
and watch over our new king.

00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:32.617
- Lord Yoo, please prepare the soldiers.
- I will do as you command.

00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:35.662
- Deok-chul.
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.163
While I am away,

00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:40.750
make sure to take good care of Her Grace.

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:42.126
Yes, Your Highness.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.736
Oh my, my lord.

00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:10.488
Make way!

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.741
We only wish to make a living.

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:15.410
Step back!

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:16.661
I said step back!

00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:19.122
You need not be so angry.

00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:21.541
How dare they harm something
that belongs to me?

00:33:21.624 --> 00:33:23.001
They should be taught a lesson.

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:24.002
Make way!

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.381
Cook Yeon.

00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:34.095
What are you doing here?

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.263
Don't worry.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.848
Go.

00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:38.141
Go, now!

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:41.019
Hang in there.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.895
You have to stay strong.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:44.689
Bang!

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.150
Okay?

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.443
Do not do anything foolish.

00:33:48.985 --> 00:33:50.111
I have a plan of my own.

00:33:58.494 --> 00:33:59.537
Step back!

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.621
Cook Yeon!

00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:05.710
My goodness. All right, we are leaving.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:07.837
Hurry along!

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.422
Let us get going.

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:10.965
- Cook Yeon.
- Hurry!

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.219
Cook Yeon.

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:16.888
Cook Yeon…

00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:47.960
Halt.

00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:50.129
- Drag him out!
- Yes, sir!

00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:01.974
I will not say much.

00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:04.769
Blame the heavens.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.648
Of course.

00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:12.401
Just as expected, Uncle.

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:16.030
Now.

00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:27.667
Your Majesty, are you unharmed?

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:35.591
You made it in time.

00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:40.805
Here is your royal sword, Your Majesty.

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.192
My first prediction was correct.

00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:55.695
My second one will be as well.

00:35:57.363 --> 00:35:58.406
You will see.

00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:00.408
I am certain

00:36:01.784 --> 00:36:03.494
my uncle will come to check my dead body.

00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:07.456
Eliminating him then

00:36:08.457 --> 00:36:10.459
is the last thing I can do for Jinmyeong

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:12.670
as a dethroned king.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.059
Oh dear.

00:36:28.227 --> 00:36:31.731
I see I overestimated you, Your Majesty.

00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:35.276
I thought you would have
a decent group of followers.

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.736
But this is it?

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:40.573
Unless you have other plans,

00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.075
you will die here today.

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.162
Your Majesty!

00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:50.666
Cook Yeon.

00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:53.794
I'm here to save you.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.088
Gong-gil and these men
are here to save you.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.466
Gong-gil.

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.343
Cook Yeon!

00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:01.385
Miss!

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:05.097
Cook Yeon!

00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:06.515
- Miss!
- Chief Royal Cook!

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.142
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:09.769
Gil-geum.

00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:11.312
What are you all doing here?

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:13.856
Gong-gil told us of the plan.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.815
What?

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.486
All right then.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.490
Let us have some fun!

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.660
Let us go!

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:31.624
The royal kitchen cooks and jesters.

00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:33.876
What a useless bunch of fools.

00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:45.805
Archers!

00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.935
Shields!

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:58.109
Fire!

00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:04.740
Fire!

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.882
Now!

00:38:23.592 --> 00:38:25.136
Strike down the rebels!

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.096
Oh my, miss!

00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:12.892
Those damned bastards.

00:39:12.975 --> 00:39:14.935
Spears! Forward!

00:39:32.953 --> 00:39:34.955
- Step back!
- Stay away!

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.415
- Gochogaru!
- Cook Sim!

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:38.334
Throw the gochogaru!

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.316
Cook Yeon!

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.734
I am here!

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:07.988
Am I late?

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:11.075
No. You're right on time.

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:14.078
I will get to use these
to my heart's content.

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:16.664
Su for "hand," and tu for "throw."

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.749
Behold, sututan, you scoundrels!

00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:56.620
Your Highness, we must retreat for now.

00:40:57.204 --> 00:40:58.038
Those damned…

00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:01.459
All because of that
wretched chief royal cook again!

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.512
Miss!

00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:58.015
- We won!
- We won!

00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:00.559
- We won!
- We won!

00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:01.977
It is not over yet.

00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:04.104
Capture Grand Prince Jesan!

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.439
Heon!

00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:13.197
Cook Yeon.

00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.282
Do you remember

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:18.285
where we drank together
before you ascended the throne?

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.663
Wolyeongru.

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:22.039
Let us meet there.

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:24.041
If you do not come alone…

00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:29.380
the chief royal cook will die.

00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:37.304
How dare that damned bastard
take a woman hostage?

00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:42.434
Your Majesty, I will go save her.

00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:44.061
I will go as well!

00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:45.646
- Me too!
- Me too!

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:46.772
Please let us join!

00:42:46.855 --> 00:42:48.691
Miss!

00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:52.403
I am the one my uncle wants.

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:54.738
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, you cannot go.

00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:56.156
It is dangerous!

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:59.410
Do not worry. I will return.

00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:01.537
While I save the chief royal cook,

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.497
you all must eliminate
the rest of my uncle's men

00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:05.291
and reclaim the palace.

00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:06.709
Your Majesty.

00:43:07.793 --> 00:43:11.171
- No, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.339
Miss!

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.843
Attack!

00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:22.141
{\an8}Lord Sung. We received word
that Grand Prince Jesan was defeated.

00:43:22.224 --> 00:43:25.227
{\an8}What? His troops were annihilated?

00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:30.107
{\an8}Leave the rest to me and go!

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.359
We are heading to Gangnyeongjeon!

00:43:36.322 --> 00:43:40.326
Are you not the assassin
from Salgoji Forest?

00:43:41.201 --> 00:43:43.370
Then why did you side with the king?

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:46.123
Because what you lot were doing

00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:47.416
was more foul than filth.

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.343
I will not die like this.

00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:59.178
Not like this!

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:03.724
Your Highness.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:08.479
What happened to the world
you promised us?

00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:11.106
Do not stand back!

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.233
Strike down the rebels!

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:28.791
Your Majesty.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.168
Please return safely.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.880
I cannot believe that the palace
was reclaimed so easily.

00:44:35.631 --> 00:44:39.510
We greatly underestimated
the dethroned king.

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.561
{\an8}I yearned for a reign of peace.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.817
{\an8}But it was nothing but a fleeting dream!

00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:01.198
Your Highness…

00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:14.044
Is anyone there?

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:40.112
Your Grace.

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:43.323
You…

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.200
You are…

00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:47.870
I am here to take revenge for my sister.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.496
And also…

00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:54.877
for all the women you used then discarded.

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.380
One who bears a sword with a grin

00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.966
will eventually be struck by it.

00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:08.515
I will never beg for my life
to you lowly scoundrel.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.350
You wench!

00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:14.396
Do you know how many lives you have taken?

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.362
I am but a jester, just like yourself.

00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:24.364
Do not be ridiculous.

00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:29.369
You have no right
to call yourself a jester.

00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:36.877
That is not for you to decide.

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:56.688
This…

00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:01.109
is for my sister.

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:01.461
It is all over, Chief Royal Cook.

00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:09.177
This time, for once,

00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:12.931
I stand with His Majesty.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:29.573
WOLYEONGRU

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:45.505
I knew he would come.

00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:50.552
The love that makes him
do anything for you.

00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:52.679
It is so very touching.

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:56.850
Will having company on one's way to hell
make the journey more pleasurable?

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:14.159
I see you are unharmed.

00:49:14.826 --> 00:49:15.702
That is a relief.

00:49:30.092 --> 00:49:31.134
Step aside.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.520
Uncle.

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:45.857
You took my cook
that even the Ming could not take.

00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:47.651
Are you prepared to face the consequences?

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.663
Did you yourself come here prepared?

00:50:00.914 --> 00:50:03.792
Let us see if you can reach me.

00:50:05.585 --> 00:50:06.920
I will make you come to me.

00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:20.767
{\an8}MANGUNROK

00:50:27.482 --> 00:50:28.358
Cook Yeon.

00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:57.345
Not bad.

00:51:30.128 --> 00:51:31.463
Your Majesty!

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:32.964
Cook Yeon!

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:37.469
Cook Yeon! Get away from here!

00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:38.428
Hurry!

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.723
No.

00:51:42.224 --> 00:51:43.391
I can't go on my own.

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.726
Do not worry about me.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:45.727
Go!

00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:53.109
{\an8}MANGUNROK

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:58.698
No way.

00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:01.117
Is this Mangunrok?

00:52:07.332 --> 00:52:08.166
Next

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.418
is the potage.

00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:13.588
"Mangunrok"?

00:52:14.172 --> 00:52:15.465
They're recipes.

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:18.051
Today's special dinner menu

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:19.511
is doenjang pasta.

00:52:20.053 --> 00:52:24.182
The dish I prepared today
is a German dish called schnitzel.

00:52:24.683 --> 00:52:28.228
It is crunchy on the outside,
but moist and chewy on the inside.

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:31.982
These are the foods
I made for His Majesty.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.279
I used butter instead of sesame oil.

00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:38.989
It is just barley rice.

00:52:40.782 --> 00:52:42.200
Why is this page torn?

00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:44.119
HWANSEBAN

00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:53.712
"My dearly beloved…"

00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:55.088
My dearly beloved,

00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:58.383
if you were to read this someday…

00:52:58.466 --> 00:53:00.677
"…may you come back…"

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.845
…may you come back

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:03.930
to my side.

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.308
I don't believe it.

00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:09.227
Mangunrok was written

00:53:10.478 --> 00:53:11.605
by His Majesty?

00:53:19.237 --> 00:53:21.531
- Do not just stand there. Get that wench!
- Yes, Your Highness!

00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.045
Uncle.

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.673
It is not too late to sheathe your sword.

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.801
It is your great fortune
that you have escaped death

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:43.261
time and time again.

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.932
It is retribution for your sins

00:53:47.515 --> 00:53:48.892
to die by my sword.

00:53:48.975 --> 00:53:50.477
Uncle!

00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.898
Power you cannot control
is nothing but a poison!

00:54:05.867 --> 00:54:06.701
No!

00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:32.102
Cook Yeon.

00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:35.522
No.

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:37.440
Cook Yeon!

00:55:00.088 --> 00:55:01.006
Cook Yeon.

00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:09.806
Your Majesty…

00:55:10.932 --> 00:55:12.058
Do not speak.

00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:14.644
I actually…

00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:20.066
didn't want to leave.

00:55:21.234 --> 00:55:22.610
Where would you dare leave

00:55:23.778 --> 00:55:25.155
without my permission?

00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:48.887
I love you,

00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:51.014
Your Majesty.

00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:02.317
Cook Yeon.

00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:04.736
Cook Yeon.

00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:07.781
I beg of you. Please open your eyes.

00:56:10.825 --> 00:56:12.827
Please!

00:56:26.633 --> 00:56:30.011
{\an8}HWANSEBAN

00:56:30.762 --> 00:56:32.847
Please open your eyes.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.520
Please…

00:56:40.772 --> 00:56:41.815
Please…

00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.070
No…

00:56:47.153 --> 00:56:48.238
No.

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:50.990
Please, no…

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.159
No…

00:56:57.956 --> 00:56:58.832
Please.

00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.668
No.

00:57:08.883 --> 00:57:10.593
No, Cook Yeon…

00:57:28.403 --> 00:57:31.281
The Mangunrok she desperately searched for

00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:34.617
was my journal.

00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:40.540
Why now?

00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:43.334
Why?

00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:46.671
Why?

00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:32.634
No.

00:58:49.108 --> 00:58:50.276
Cook Yeon.

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:56.699
Cook Yeon!

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.091
Wherever you are,

00:59:13.633 --> 00:59:15.093
I will find you.

00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:23.601
I will send you along with her!

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:53.798
Heon…

00:59:54.465 --> 00:59:56.384
I should have been

00:59:57.176 --> 00:59:58.469
the king of Joseon.

00:59:59.887 --> 01:00:00.847
Uncle.

01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:05.685
Please go in peace.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.007
Your Majesty.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.218
Please don't forget your promise

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:41.095
to find me.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.985
WOORI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.798
No!

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.805
Where am I?

01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:26.391
A hospital?

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.477
Am I back?

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:38.611
This wound…

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:40.655
It wasn't a dream.

01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:42.532
Then what about His Majesty?

01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:43.866
What happened to him?

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.535
No!

01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:49.414
Mangunrok.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:51.541
Where is it?

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.590
I have to go back.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.059
Ji-young.

01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:14.355
You're awake.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.066
Dad.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.736
Do you know how worried I was?

01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:21.988
Dad.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.368
Just a moment. Are you all right?

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.704
You can't move around all of a sudden.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:45.511
Ji-young.

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:49.265
Stay home and rest
while I get some groceries, okay?

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:50.725
- Okay.
- I'll be quick.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.630
{\an8}THE REAL BASIC COOKBOOK

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:37.855
Cook Yeon!

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:39.232
Get away from here!

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:42.068
No. I can't go on my own.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.444
Do not worry about me.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.570
Go!

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.032
No!

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.202
No. Cook Yeon.

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:53.496
Cook Yeon.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.373
Cook Yeon.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.875
I beg of you. Please open your eyes.

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:02.171
Please!

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:08.678
No…

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.865
YEONHUIGUN

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.372
YEONHUIGUN

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:38.416
{\an8}FOOD EQUALS POLITICS…

01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:39.333
DETHRONED KING OF JOSEON

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:43.254
"Yeonhuigun's body was never found"?

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:45.590
"Yeonhuigun went missing"?

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.925
History changed.

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:51.679
I might

01:04:52.513 --> 01:04:54.807
be able to meet him again if I go back.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:04:59.729
Give me your word.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:02.356
Promise me…

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:05.860
that you will come back to me.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:09.906
MANGUNROK

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:15.786
"My dearly beloved,

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.956
if you were to read this someday,

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.168
may you come back to my side."

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.388
No.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.143
"My dearly beloved,

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.145
if…

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.982
you were to read this someday,

01:05:45.816 --> 01:05:47.109
may you

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:49.445
come back to my side."

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:14.553
It's not working.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:17.306
Why won't it work?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.604
The bathroom.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:41.664
"My dearly beloved,

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:46.377
if you were to read this someday…

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.882
may you come back to my side."

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.683
I'll show you.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.060
Open up.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.365
What if…

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.744
I want to come back but can't?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:03.996
In that case,

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.540
I will find you.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:10.544
I hope…

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:15.299
that wasn't our last day together.

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:36.278
ONE MONTH LATER

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.253
Oh, Chef Yeon.

01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:53.254
Hey.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:56.257
You look well.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.343
Were you surprised to hear from me?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.887
I guess a little bit.

01:09:02.429 --> 01:09:03.430
What's up?

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.141
Nothing's up. It's just…

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.102
- Let's do business together.
- What?

01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:10.688
Michelin has begun their selection process
here in Korea.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.694
I'm sorry, but I'm not exactly
thinking about working right now.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.530
If you can't work full-time,
then just one month.

01:09:20.114 --> 01:09:22.158
Just until we find a decent chef.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.578
If we don't receive
a Michelin star again this time,

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.455
the hotel will shut down the restaurant.

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:32.585
Please, Ji-young.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.838
Can I see the kitchen?

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:36.881
Come this way.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:00.529
Might as well.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:02.448
I'll do it.

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.657
Chef Yeon.

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:10.331
May I taste the dessert?

01:10:30.851 --> 01:10:32.978
It's just for a month though.

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:34.605
Okay.

01:10:34.688 --> 01:10:37.608
And if you want a Michelin star,

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:39.818
this menu won't cut it.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.862
I'll try developing a new one.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.572
The dish you won during the competition?

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:44.990
No.

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:49.787
Fine dining that incorporates
Joseon royal cuisine.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:51.622
You know how to cook royal cuisine?

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:59.964
This is Yeon Ji-young,
Enfin's new head chef.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.174
- Hello, Chef.
- Hello, Chef.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.092
No way.

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:04.593
Cook Eom!

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.137
Cook Maeng!

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:08.389
Cook Sim!

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:10.557
Cook Min!

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:12.893
Gil-geum!

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:14.645
Sorry?

01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:16.438
My name is Sun-geum.

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:17.982
What?

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:20.067
SEO SUN-GEUM

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:21.902
This is unbelievable.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.529
How can they look so alike?

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:25.698
Are they their descendants?

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.866
They look too much alike
for it to be a coincidence.

01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:34.248
I'm Yeon Ji-young, and I'll be overseeing
the kitchen at Enfin.

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:35.833
I hope we get along.

01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:37.501
La Poêle d'Or.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.169
- Oh, the winner?
- For real?

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:41.338
- Oh, the--
- That's enough.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:45.801
We're going to develop a new menu
for the upcoming Michelin evaluation.

01:11:45.884 --> 01:11:46.885
And…

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:51.223
I plan on creating a dining course
inspired by the royal kitchen

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:55.769
that was in charge of serving meals
to the kings of the Joseon Dynasty.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.313
I have a feeling

01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:59.815
we'll do great as a team.

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:02.693
- I look forward to working with you.
- I look forward to working with you.

01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:09.241
Just like that,
I returned to the life I used to live.

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:10.993
But

01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:13.287
my heart and my time

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.622
remained in the Joseon royal kitchen.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:20.210
I took the royal cuisine I'd come across
as the chief royal cook

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:23.422
and the dishes His Majesty
had recorded in Mangunrok

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.549
to create a new menu.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:29.011
I applied the techniques
I'd learned in Paris

01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:31.388
toward developing a royal dining course.

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:36.852
And I named it

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:39.313
the Chief Royal Cook's Dining Course.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.332
Chef Yeon, take a look at this.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.251
NATURE-INFUSED MODERN ROYAL KOREAN CUISINE
CHIEF ROYAL COOK'S COURSE HIGHLY PRAISED!

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:02.419
Highly praised?

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:03.879
Chef!

01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:07.132
Congratulations!

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:10.969
- She's awesome.
- Congratulations, Chief Royal Cook!

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.221
Three Chief Royal Cook courses.

01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:13.806
Prepare your dishes, everyone.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.224
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:26.985
Good evening, sir.
Did you make a reservation?

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.238
A table at 7 p.m. for Steve Im.

01:13:29.863 --> 01:13:32.616
Great, thank you. Please follow me.

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:50.926
I heard there's a new menu here.

01:13:51.009 --> 01:13:52.261
CHIEF ROYAL COOK

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:54.179
Modern Korean cuisine, Chief Royal Cook.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:55.722
Yes, sir.

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.933
We've reinterpreted dishes
that were served to the king

01:13:58.016 --> 01:13:59.726
as a modern course meal.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.186
It's Enfin's signature course.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.396
I'll order that.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.274
Can I get two glasses
of mineral water first?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.734
Yes, of course.

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:11.697
Chef Yeon.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.073
The Chief Royal Cook course
for table seven.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:15.367
It's Michelin.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:18.162
He asked for two glasses of water
and had two phones.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.583
Just do as you always have, okay?

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:24.251
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:25.544
The consommé looks great.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.212
- Please plate it up.
- Yes, Chef.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.132
The beef tartare with seaweed
gets soggy easily,

01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:31.842
- so make sure to plate it on time.
- Yes, Chef.

01:14:31.925 --> 01:14:34.052
- Slice it a bit thinner.
- Yes, Chef.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.305
It's ready to be plated, so Cook Maeng…

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:37.514
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.684
Chef Maeng, please prepare the garnish
for the bourguignon.

01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:41.727
Yes, Chef.

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:52.863
- Dessert for table seven.
- Yes, Chef.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.657
Chef.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.160
The guest at table seven
said it tasted bad.

01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:01.079
He says the meat is dry
and wants it remade.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.999
What? He didn't even touch the food.

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:06.877
I'll serve him.

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:14.009
It has a great finish.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:17.930
Hello.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.432
I'm Yeon Ji-young, the head chef at Enfin.

01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:24.937
He looks exactly like Im Song-jae.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.605
And why are you here?

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.441
He's nitpicking here too?

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.109
Well…

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.903
You asked us to remake the short ribs

01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:35.280
braised in wild grape rice wine
and ogolgye samgyetang.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.242
Is there a problem with the food?

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:41.203
I see you didn't understand
because I was being indirect.

01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:43.580
You called it modern cuisine
that holds the essence of nature.

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:45.624
I couldn't feel the nature you spoke of.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.252
He's nitpicking over nothing.

01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:52.130
They say it's impossible
to stop a human from lying.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.760
You didn't even touch the food.

01:15:56.843 --> 01:15:59.596
Are you saying I'm lying
without tasting anything?

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.639
I have to say,

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:03.475
that's quite an impressive way
to avoid evaluation.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:06.478
You shouldn't cook if you lack the skill.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.105
Are you even with Michelin?

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.149
How can someone like you be a judge?

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.150
What did you say?

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.027
You're crossing the line.

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:16.905
How can someone like you be a chef?

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:20.158
You know what?
I'll give you a proper evaluation today.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:22.035
Blame your cooking.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.078
What?

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.163
If what you say is true…

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:31.587
I will try it myself.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.062
Who are you?

01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:52.316
What? "You"?

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.320
Do you wish to be struck down
with a sword?

01:16:56.903 --> 01:16:57.738
A sword?

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:00.824
Is he crazy? Why does he talk like that?

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:04.661
- What?
- Sir.

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.331
Let me take you to our suite.

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.415
Let go of me.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:09.499
Consider this your lucky day!

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.501
- How dare you!
- Come with me.

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:12.878
- A suite?
- Yes.

01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:18.091
Your Majesty.

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.140
Is it…

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:27.517
really you?

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.519
I came to keep my promise.

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:31.897
My promise to find you.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.988
Look at you, acting all cool.

01:17:42.282 --> 01:17:43.575
What about your seoksura, evening meal?

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:46.453
How could I enjoy it without you?

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.664
Come and taste it.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:12.497
EPILOGUE

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.811
- Hey.
- Chef Yeon.

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:37.564
The Michelin guy really was a fraud.

01:19:37.647 --> 01:19:39.941
- What?
- I called the police, and they took him.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.318
I knew it.

01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:43.069
What a jerk.

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:45.530
He deserves to pay
for messing around with food.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:46.656
Cook Yeon.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.325
I'm coming.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.286
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.915
Thank you for cooking.

01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:59.085
My goodness, what's with all this mess?

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.296
Come and sit down.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.846
It's just bibimbap.

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:11.431
"Just"?

01:20:12.557 --> 01:20:14.226
It is a royal bibinbap

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.603
that I, the king of Joseon,
made for the first time.

01:20:16.686 --> 01:20:17.854
It is called hwanseban.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:18.772
Right.

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:20.524
Do not eat if you do not want to.

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:22.567
No. I will eat it.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.028
Thank you.

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:26.613
Then…

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:31.493
Open up.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:38.667
Does it

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:40.460
taste good?

01:20:41.294 --> 01:20:43.505
It needs some brown butter.

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:45.549
"Blown batter"?

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.676
This is called beurre noisette.

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:49.719
You melt butter as if you're burning it.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:51.888
This is such a fascinating brazier.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.224
Shouldn't you change the way you talk?

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.142
How should I do that?

01:20:57.894 --> 01:20:59.396
It's hard to believe,

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:01.982
but he's from the 1500s.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:05.235
By the way, how did you find me?

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:07.654
Well…

01:21:07.737 --> 01:21:09.072
How did he get here?

01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:10.448
That is a secret.

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:12.325
That's not important.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:15.412
Because we're together again.

01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:36.433
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.045
