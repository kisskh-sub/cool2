OPEN AUDITION FOR FILM, ANGEL VILLAGE

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:38.622
Okay, thank you for your work.

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.791
-Thank you.
-Next is Ye-jin and Yun-a?

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.838
Very good. You passed.

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:51.093
Thank you for coming. You got a pass.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.514
Very nice. You're in.

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.017
You passed.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.143
You're in!

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:06.192
An eye for an eye.
Aesthetics for aesthetics.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.110
Beauty for beauty.

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.198
All right. We'll begin the shoot now.

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:20.164
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.482
Left or right?

00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:48.359
What?

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:52.196
Make up your mind
whether you'll go left or right.

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.661
Police... I should call...

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:06.627
EPISODE 8

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.170
THE LOONEY PUBLISHER

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:14.552
Was it that scary when I told you
to decide whether to go left or right?

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.972
No, you were murmuring.
I didn't get what you were saying.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.101
It's my serious face that's the problem.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:31.068
Anyway, what brings you
to my publishing house?

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:34.780
KOREA! JOURNEY TO FIND A LEGEND!

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:39.493
I was wondering if I could get a hold
of the writer of this book, Mr. Gray.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.457
Unfortunately, Mr. Gray is…

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.419
me.

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:50.379
That's my pen name.

00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:55.676
You've come to the right place.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.180
Then, do you remember
Manbaeksan Mountain Beautifying Toner?

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:02.808
I should sign an autograph for you.

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:04.476
Oh, it's okay.

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:08.522
There are two things
that can't be hidden in the world.

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.191
Sneezing and a fan's love.

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.402
No need to refuse.

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.322
Where do you want it? Where…

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.659
Oh, my. What are you…

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.120
Oh, no!

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:29.627
-Ta-da! A luxury bag.
-What on earth are you doing?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.047
That bag's worth 15 million won!

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.383
Now it's worth 150 million won.

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.765
No need to feel pressured.
I don't mind doing that for my fan.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.145
Wow. Just wow.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.899
It'll get even more expensive after I die,

00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:55.653
so don't sell it until I die.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.284
Well…

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:08.290
About that water that appears
in "All Over the Country After Legend"…

00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:10.084
-Beautifying Toner.
-Yes.

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:14.296
That Beautifying Toner.
Where can I find it?

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:15.839
Nephew.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.258
"Screw you"?

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.096
Nephew.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:32.523
My nephew probably knows.

00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:38.654
Is he Jekyll and Hyde or what?
Why is he all over the place? Seriously.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:58.632
Thank you for coming with us, Editor.

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:02.219
I'm only being fan-friendly.

00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:06.223
Oh, jeez.

00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:10.769
It's good that I get to meet
my darn nephew after a long time.

00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:16.150
There's a heartbreaking story
about the town we're heading to right now.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.693
Would you like to hear it?

00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:19.361
Let me tell you.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:24.408
This story began a long, long time ago,

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.579
deep in the woods of Manbaeksan Mountain.

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:34.918
The world is vast and full of women,

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:37.212
but a woman of unparalleled beauty

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:41.091
is uncommon at all times
and in all places.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:44.970
However, in a secluded village
in Gangwon Province back in the era,

00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:51.143
there was a beautiful woman
whose beauty excelled even Hwang Jin-yi's.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:56.648
-Un-nyun, you're so pretty!
-All men wandered around Un-nyun.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.949
It is a royal order!

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:09.244
Herb Gatherer Kim Yong-bok
has a place to go.

00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:10.788
You must hurry!

00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:14.625
It must be an urgent patient.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.130
I learned how to handle medicine from you.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:21.757
I will go instead.

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.718
Un-nyun, with a matchless beauty,

00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:28.889
followed them, having no idea

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:33.102
what ordeal was waiting for her.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.707
Please forgive me
for overstepping my bounds,

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.044
but instead of a mere monk like me
and a physician,

00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:03.632
-perhaps he needs an exorcist monk?
-How dare you speak so!

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.969
Are you saying His Majesty is possessed?

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.512
What are you doing just sitting there?

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.389
Hurry up and go in there!

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:45.841
When your body becomes weak
and your heart is troubled,

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.594
you start to hear things
you shouldn't hear,

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.513
and see things you shouldn't see.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.724
Therefore,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.477
it is only normal for you

00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.605
to lose control of your body and heart.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.492
Un-nyun's beautiful face

00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:15.412
was imprinted in the king's mind.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:20.709
Her beauty became addictive to him.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.172
The king, who wanted to keep Un-nyun
by his side,

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:29.051
put up Un-nyun's posters everywhere.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.804
However, men who didn't want
to send Un-nyun to the palace

00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:35.015
united and kept their mouths closed.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.768
I bet the king found Un-nyun in the end.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.228
You got it.

00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:43.982
The king put a huge reward on Un-nyun.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:50.447
As a result, even the gangs
were eager to catch Un-nyun.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:54.534
Wow, amazing, don't you think?

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:56.536
Hey, wait right there!

00:08:57.371 --> 00:08:59.957
Oh, you must be Un-nyun. Right?

00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:01.625
You look the same.

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.294
Who are you?

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:08.090
I'm the chaser, Big Noggin.

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:16.390
What? Move out of the way.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.183
No, where… Where are you going?

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:20.185
-Move!
-Hold him.

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.104
Where are you going?

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:29.987
Un-nyun!

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.504
Look!

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.756
Please let my daughter go!

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.844
How can the king,
who possesses the whole world,

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.430
take the only daughter
of a poor old man like me?

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:59.891
Let me go. How can I stop the king
from doing whatever he wants?

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:01.476
I'm begging you.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.563
-Let me go. Hey…
-Please!

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.031
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:27.961
Don't look!

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.802
I'd rather die
than get stuck in the palace.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:39.473
And it's better to run than die.
I must run.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.850
I must run until I can't.

00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.941
We've finally met. Yi-rang…

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:52.569
Un-nyun!

00:10:54.613 --> 00:10:57.949
The chaser, Big Noggin,
was always bitter and rougher

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.534
than anybody in the world.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.790
Yet, the woman's eyes and breath

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:08.877
were enough to melt his heart.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:10.629
Hey…

00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:14.925
Well, do you…

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:19.096
Do you want to go
to the nearest magistrate's office?

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.431
Why should I?

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.310
You should be happy
to receive the king's grace.

00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:26.895
Do you truly mean it?

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:30.399
Everyone's desperate to enter the palace,
from what I've noticed.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:32.234
Well, if you become a court maid,

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.945
your family won't starve,
thanks to government food aid.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.406
-If you give birth to a prince--
-Do you think the biggest honor

00:11:37.948 --> 00:11:40.492
for a woman born in Joseon
is becoming the king's woman

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.411
and giving birth to a prince?

00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:45.372
My goodness.

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:47.499
Well, you'll get caught

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.460
by someone anyway.

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:53.463
Then, why don't you just come with me?

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:55.298
There she is! Get her!

00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.676
Gosh, why did they have to come so fast?

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.428
Leave them to me.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.596
In the meantime,
wait for me under that sacred tree.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.515
Hurry. Move fast.

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.536
Hey, come in at once.

00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:00.030
Stuck?

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.568
Fine.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.281
Darn it.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:44.616
Please don't kill me!

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.619
Sure. Work hard, man.

00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:06.263
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.891
Come with me to the palace.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:17.857
Jeez, why didn't she run away?

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.241
Un-nyun!

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:28.660
Who are you?

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:34.666
Halt!

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.423
Kill him,

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:43.341
and bring Un-nyun.

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:44.259
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:56.730
The two ran all night long
to avoid the chasers.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:00.233
To a man and a woman
who were old enough to get married,

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.611
that moment became eternity

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:07.073
eternally, eternally, and eternally.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.036
Have a seat here first. This way.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:14.664
Thank you.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:17.417
If you walk down this way,
you'll find a dock.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.836
If you get on a raft there,
you'll find a way to survive.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.298
-I got you in trouble. I'm sorry.
-No.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.175
Don't say that since it was my choice.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.845
Man, sacrificing myself
for a beautiful woman.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.222
Isn't that wonderful?

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:55.580
Un-nyun got hit by the arrow
the king shot at Big Noggin.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.418
Un-nyun!

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:06.257
The king, who became furious,
even killed Big Noggin.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.345
Don't forget me.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.181
Look at me.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.308
Un-nyun.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:16.935
Un-nyun!

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.145
Un-nyun!

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.773
-That's how
-Un-nyun!

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:26.444
the two left this world.

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:30.407
Un-nyun!

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:34.077
The village
where Un-nyun and Big Noggin died

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.246
was cursed by a major grudge,

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.789
-so it's called Keunhani.
-Keunhani.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.458
The village where Un-nyun's father
died from an illness

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.919
after hearing that his daughter had died

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.422
was cursed by a minor grudge,

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.589
so it's called Jageunhani.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:51.428
-Jageunhani.
-That's how the village names remain.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:56.015
A pond was created in the place
where pretty Un-nyun died.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:17:01.354
The village women who drank and washed
with that water became beautiful,

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.648
so it's called Engel Village.

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:04.774
Engel Village?

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:06.151
Angel Village.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.194
Oh, Angel Village.

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:09.237
That's a lie.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.533
It's only a mere myth.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.535
A story passed down
since the time the tiger smoked.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.372
My darn nephew is ruining the mood again.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.665
I'm Kim Jin-man.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.959
I'm the representative
of this region's tourist association.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.837
I also run a small real estate office
in the central market over there.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.214
He is my darn nephew.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.258
-That darn brat.
-The darn nephew.

00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:32.343
-What?
-That brat. My darn nephew.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:38.308
Oh, this is Gil Beauty,
my number one fan and CEO of Mystique.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.894
What? Wow!

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.646
The cosmetics that Sun-ja uses?

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.981
For makeup?

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:47.400
Is your wife's name Sun-ja?

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:48.777
What's wrong with you?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.029
It's the girl in the downtown cafe.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:56.201
Anyway, why is someone
so great and gorgeous

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.412
sitting down here
listening to that gibberish?

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.247
Gibberish? You little…

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.625
It's true. I mean, think about it.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:06.336
-Do you think Angel Village makes sense?
-Of course, it does. You brat.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.420
Does it?

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:14.886
What the heck?

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:16.805
Why is her skin so clear?

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.182
Enjoy.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.059
Oh, thank you.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:24.896
Gosh, it's so hot.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.606
Is this lava?

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:31.152
Wait.

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:33.822
She's also extraordinary.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:39.744
Don't worry.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.165
Right.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.126
Even those old ladies over there.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.337
Their skin is glowing like crazy.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:54.592
Again?

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.429
Even the girls outside are all pretty.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.060
How come everyone here has such nice skin?

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:05.395
Perhaps…

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:11.693
I think…

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.027
BEAUTIFYING TONER

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.321
…you might know what this is.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.617
"Beautifying Toner."

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.495
Is that a girl group name?

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:24.247
Then…

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:26.916
how about this lady?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.209
Have you seen her before?

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:29.794
Eun-seol.

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.838
Choi Eun-seol from Keunhani.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:34.799
I thought that village was gone now.

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:37.302
It's gone, but people here
still call it Keunhani

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.095
since we've gotten so used to it.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.930
What did I tell you?

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:44.267
It's real. The Beautifying Toner
and the Angel Village.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:52.400
We have to meet the lady
named Choi Eun-seol.

00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:54.235
Can you show us the way?

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.363
Oh, this is bad.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:01.034
You see, Eun-seol,
that girl hates meeting people.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:02.410
What should we do?

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:05.371
She used to be bright and cheerful.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.251
Gosh, Eun-seol.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.718
If you help us meet her,

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:20.053
we'll give you more.

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:23.723
What…

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:27.226
Gosh, I shouldn't be taking this.

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.270
It would be a shame!

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.064
But you're shameless, you brat.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.441
So, is that your car?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.531
MANBAEKSAN MOUNTAIN GAS STATION

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:41.991
I'll pump some gas.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.247
How much would you like?

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:52.418
Pretty… I mean, fill it up, please.

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:55.588
Okay.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.054
Why does everyone in this town
have clear skin?

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.352
With some makeup on,

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.771
anyone would believe
that she's a member of a girl group.

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.984
Secretary Choi.

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:17.568
Yes?

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:27.203
A pond was created in the place
where pretty Un-nyun died.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:32.000
The village women who drank and washed
with that water became beautiful,

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.960
so it's called Engel Village.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.764
The air is so fresh.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:50.727
-From here, we have to walk.
-How far?

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.895
-About 15 minutes?
-Fifteen minutes?

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:57.942
Avalokitesvara.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:05.616
What?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.078
Even the monks' skin is glowing.

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:11.164
What's going on?

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:17.045
Oh, they're pretty. How did we cast them?

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.756
Hurry up. This way!

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:24.719
-Be careful. It's slippery.
-It's slippery.

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:26.179
It's about 15 minutes away.

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:28.931
NO ENTRANCE EXCEPT FOR VILLAGERS
THIS AREA IS PRIVATE PROPERTY

00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:31.476
Seol, are you home?

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.810
Are you home?

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:34.228
Is this

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.856
where she lives?

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:46.699
-Secretary Choi?
-Yes?

00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:51.829
Where are you going?

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:59.378
-Oh, wait.
-Can you help me?

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.841
Wait.

00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.009
Thank you.

00:23:06.177 --> 00:23:07.095
There.

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:15.144
Is this the well of Angel Village?

00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:19.398
No, the natural sparkling water
used as a base for the Beautifying Toner?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.819
We'll have to analyze its components.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.321
Yes. Right.

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:26.823
Okay.

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.452
What are you doing on my property?

00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:35.456
Gosh.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.958
Wait. Oh, thank you.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:40.753
Well…

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.715
You forgot this, Ms. Choi Eun-seol.

00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:50.680
Hey, why did you bring people
without telling me?

00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:52.723
Get your act together.

00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:54.142
Why did you have to forget that

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:56.435
and make these busy people
come all the way here?

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:59.272
Take it. Although there's barely any left.

00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:02.525
-Here.
-Thank you for bringing it back for me.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:05.903
-Bye, then.
-It was a good toner.

00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:09.949
Were you selling that in this town?

00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:11.117
Why do you ask?

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.453
Are you going to report me
for selling fake products?

00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:16.289
Why would I report you?

00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:21.377
I was wondering if what I saw
at the cafe earlier was the same product.

00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:25.464
I wonder if everyone here has nice skin
because of that.

00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:28.593
That has nothing to do with this.

00:24:30.178 --> 00:24:31.637
Hey, you little brat!

00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:34.932
-What's wrong with you?
-The famous CEO Gil Beauty

00:24:35.016 --> 00:24:37.935
descended all the way here from Seoul…

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:39.187
Descended?

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.897
-Of course, she descended.
-Right!

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.858
How can you shut people out,
living in this nice town

00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:45.985
with good water and good people?

00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.945
-Jeez.
-He's right. That's absurd.

00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:50.323
I'm not telling you to do anything.

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:53.451
Just show them what it is.

00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:54.911
Show us.

00:24:55.453 --> 00:24:56.913
Show us.

00:24:58.206 --> 00:24:59.040
Well…

00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:02.752
Then, follow me.

00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:13.596
Here.

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:28.736
Is this all

00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:31.113
Beautifying Toner?

00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:33.616
Yes.

00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:37.078
Did you make this alone?

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.538
Yes, since my mother passed away.

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:44.961
Wait, are you saying that your mother
developed the Beautifying Toner?

00:25:45.044 --> 00:25:47.380
Oh, no.

00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:53.427
My grandma's grandma
was a maebungu or something.

00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:57.056
A maebungu?

00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:59.141
That's a cosmetics merchant
during the Joseon Dynasty.

00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:01.143
Is the Beautifying Toner
a natural cosmetic

00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:03.187
that's been produced for generations?

00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:05.898
If you're done, you should go.

00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.943
It's not easy to get to the village
when it gets dark.

00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:11.904
I have a lot of questions
about the Beautifying Toner.

00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:13.030
Stop it.

00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:15.032
Why are you doing this to me?

00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:16.325
You're scaring me!

00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:21.580
What's wrong with her?

00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:24.458
That was out of the blue.

00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:27.169
What did I even do?

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:32.675
Father.

00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:35.636
Father.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.139
Where are you, Father?

00:26:38.723 --> 00:26:43.019
Now that you're gone,
strangers are coming to our house.

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.520
I'm so scared.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.275
Father.

00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:58.034
I deserve a best actress award.

00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:02.413
Father!

00:27:03.164 --> 00:27:05.041
Father!

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.422
-Strangers are here!
-Is it really worth crying that much?

00:27:12.882 --> 00:27:15.760
She has a story.

00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:17.428
How great can her story be?

00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:20.014
You wouldn't believe it,

00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:22.391
but Eun-seol used to be
bright and cheerful.

00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:23.934
Bright, my foot.

00:27:24.018 --> 00:27:26.979
She was as prickly as a hedgehog.

00:27:27.063 --> 00:27:29.065
So much for being cheerful.
She was daring.

00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:30.775
Let me tell you what happened.

00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:33.652
It's gone now, but about ten years ago,

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.738
people from a very famous cosmetic company

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:38.032
came here to develop
the Beautifying Toner.

00:27:38.616 --> 00:27:40.493
Oh, someone was already after it?

00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:41.577
Right.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.539
Someone must've contacted her
for such a megahit item.

00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:49.668
If they had just waited,
they could've sat on a pile of money.

00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:53.005
But her father suddenly went crazy

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:55.257
and took off with the deposit
that the company gave him.

00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:56.759
What a crazy bastard.

00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:58.928
He was no father. He was an enemy.

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:01.430
Her father fell into a huge debt

00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:05.017
while gambling and went missing.

00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:09.021
Eun-seol thinks it's all because
they broke the taboo.

00:28:09.522 --> 00:28:10.606
What taboo?

00:28:12.441 --> 00:28:14.026
The taboo that prohibits

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.570
the Beautifying Toner recipe
from leaving the town.

00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:21.575
So, since the villagers made their living
from selling Beautifying Toner,

00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:25.830
they must have made that taboo
to keep the secret from getting out.

00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:29.417
Hey, Uncle, you're smart.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.584
Hey!

00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:32.545
Don't "hey" your uncle, you brat.

00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:37.174
-I'm correct, you damn nephew!
-Father!

00:28:37.258 --> 00:28:38.884
Father!

00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:45.391
-I'm so sad, Father.
-Ma'am, what should we do?

00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:47.768
This is a pain in the neck.

00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:50.146
You know what?

00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:53.274
Never mind.

00:28:56.694 --> 00:28:57.736
You see…

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:01.991
-Never mind.
-You little…

00:29:03.993 --> 00:29:06.287
-Gosh…
-What? What is it?

00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:09.748
I'm not sure if I should tell you…

00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:11.876
Just say it. Spill it out. Say it!

00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:13.961
Do it! Say it!

00:29:14.044 --> 00:29:15.754
Will you, please?

00:29:18.674 --> 00:29:22.011
If you promise not to tell anyone,
I will tell you.

00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:25.598
I'll keep the secret. So tell me.

00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:28.225
Off road? What's that?

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.312
Turn the record off.

00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:34.315
She'll keep the secret, you darn nephew!

00:29:34.398 --> 00:29:35.649
Oh, that's what that means?

00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:37.526
Hurry.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.904
-Hurry up and tell me already. Come on!
-Come on!

00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:43.199
Okay.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.159
Eun-seol

00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:48.954
had a tough time in the past ten years

00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:51.415
paying off her father's gambling debt.

00:29:51.499 --> 00:29:53.792
So she couldn't pay the property tax.

00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:56.170
She failed to pay off the debt.

00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:57.880
Oh, poor girl.

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:00.090
No wonder she was so prickly.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:01.634
I pity her.

00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:05.804
Should I hire her at my publishing house?

00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:07.598
Speaking of which,

00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:10.684
if you offer Eun-seol
to sell this whole mountain

00:30:10.768 --> 00:30:14.021
so she could pay
the property tax and debt,

00:30:14.104 --> 00:30:16.357
she might be swayed.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.651
You should also include
the Beautifying Toner in your offer.

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:22.738
It seems all the ingredients
are from this mountain.

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.657
It might be a good idea.

00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:27.660
With a condition
to reveal the secret to me.

00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:32.081
Of course! She has no reason
to refuse three billion won.

00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:32.998
Of course!

00:30:33.082 --> 00:30:35.125
Three billion won
will be more than enough!

00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:36.043
Of course!

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:38.879
She's naive.

00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:42.633
If I talk her into it,
I'll be able to get the patent, too.

00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:45.803
Three billion won… Hold on.

00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:54.103
The natural toner
made with the secret recipe

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:55.563
passed down since the Joseon Dynasty.

00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:59.149
Gil Beauty won't be able to shake off
the temptation of Beautifying Toner.

00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:04.363
She's now going to say
she'll buy the land.

00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:08.742
One, two, three.

00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:12.871
That's weird.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.544
One, two, three.

00:31:20.963 --> 00:31:21.797
Hold on.

00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:23.173
What the?

00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:34.476
-What…
-Ma'am?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.438
Ma'am, where are you going? Ma'am!

00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:38.606
What do we do?

00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:41.108
-What now?
-What do we do?

00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:43.068
Go. Follow her!

00:31:43.986 --> 00:31:45.487
I said follow her!

00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:46.488
Ma'am!

00:31:46.989 --> 00:31:51.785
-Gil Beauty.
-Where are you going?

00:31:53.162 --> 00:31:56.373
Wait. Where are you going in a rush?

00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:01.754
Drive me back to the teahouse.

00:32:02.796 --> 00:32:03.631
Wait.

00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:05.507
Wait!

00:32:11.347 --> 00:32:14.141
I'm in a rush…

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:16.435
Aren't you coming?

00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:19.146
No, that's…

00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:21.106
Pee.

00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:26.362
Emergency.

00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:28.822
Thank you.

00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:31.533
-Emergency.
-What?

00:32:31.617 --> 00:32:34.787
Gil Beauty is going back to the teahouse.
Act natural.

00:32:35.329 --> 00:32:37.373
Oh, okay. Wait!

00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:44.129
Let's film one additional scene
before you go.

00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:46.090
It's connected to the last scene.

00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:48.759
Yes, go and naturally drink tea,
as you did earlier.

00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:50.427
Back to your positions.

00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:52.930
Move now. Hurry.

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:56.975
I'm sorry.

00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:59.144
My bad.

00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:03.982
I have a sensitive prostate.

00:33:10.614 --> 00:33:12.825
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:14.910
-Get in the car?
-I called Mr. Mustache.

00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:16.286
-Get in the car.
-Get in the car.

00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:22.960
All right. Don't be nervous.

00:33:23.043 --> 00:33:24.378
Act natural, just like before.

00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.797
All right. One, two, action!

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.634
Darn it!

00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:45.482
Excuse me.

00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:47.276
Yes, ma'am?

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.911
I knew something was strange.

00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.386
Tell me the truth.

00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:17.431
How can I help you?

00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:20.684
-I think we got caught.
-I think so, too. Should we run?

00:34:24.354 --> 00:34:25.481
Are you all…

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:35.365
using Beautifying Toner?

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.869
-What? Beautifying Toner?
-What the…

00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:42.372
Beautifying Toner…

00:34:42.456 --> 00:34:44.166
-Oh, I see.
-How did she know?

00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:46.168
That's what she meant.

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.628
Oh, yes. Beautifying Toner.

00:34:49.213 --> 00:34:51.131
I used to suffer from severe acne.

00:34:51.215 --> 00:34:53.467
But my skin became super clean
after using this,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.553
-so I've been using it since then.
-I knew it.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:58.514
I'll take them all.

00:34:58.597 --> 00:34:59.723
All of them?

00:34:59.807 --> 00:35:01.600
-Wow, that's…
-What's wrong?

00:35:01.683 --> 00:35:03.018
Isn't that enough?

00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:05.229
Oh, more than enough.

00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:12.236
Beautifying toner?

00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:18.534
I'll skip you. Beautifying Toner?

00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:19.451
Ma'am.

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:26.083
Beautifying Toner.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.294
That's a relief.

00:35:29.795 --> 00:35:30.838
What's she thinking?

00:35:31.588 --> 00:35:33.966
-That's what I mean.
-Oh, thank you for your work, everyone.

00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:37.803
Gosh, good work.

00:35:45.686 --> 00:35:47.813
Make it exactly the same as this.

00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:51.859
It won't be hard with the technology
our company has.

00:35:51.942 --> 00:35:53.443
Let's make it exactly the same,

00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:55.946
and we might as well get the patent.
Can you do it?

00:35:58.574 --> 00:36:01.326
That was her scheme. She…

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:06.665
Copying it wasn't enough,
and she's going to steal the patent too?

00:36:06.748 --> 00:36:07.791
What? That's…

00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:09.960
What?

00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:11.795
What do we do?

00:36:23.724 --> 00:36:25.976
When you have a lot on your mind,
nothing beats exercising.

00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:29.813
Yi-rang, you should've known when to stop.
Why did you have to be so cold?

00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:31.523
You're just as expected.

00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:33.066
What?

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.987
If I took a submissive attitude
and said yes to everything she said there,

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:41.867
that would've turned on
Gil Beauty's suspicion switch.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.786
Are you saying that the whole situation
was part of your plan?

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.206
No.

00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:50.542
That wasn't part of the plan.

00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:56.089
I thought if I refused one more time,
it'd turn on Gil Beauty's desire switch

00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:58.884
and make her desperate
to buy the mountain.

00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:01.553
So, instead of turning on
her desire switch,

00:37:01.637 --> 00:37:05.015
her thief switch turned on? Is that it?

00:37:05.515 --> 00:37:07.517
I admit that I failed this time.

00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:09.561
Yi-rang, come on.

00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:13.106
The fun in scamming is this
kind of unexpected situation, isn't it?

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.107
It's okay.

00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:17.527
Who do you think you are to comfort me?

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.574
I'm being nice here.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:24.743
Speaking of which,

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:30.499
you don't think Gil Beauty will manage
to copy the Beautifying Toner, right?

00:37:32.376 --> 00:37:33.752
No need to worry about that.

00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:36.880
That's never going to happen because…

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.634
she can never copy it.

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:46.807
This is a newly found plant species
at an elevation of 500 meters

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.392
in Manbaeksan Mountain early this year.

00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:51.561
It's a rare plant that the association
hasn't announced yet,

00:37:51.645 --> 00:37:54.147
so the cosmetics industry
couldn't possibly know about it.

00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:58.068
-Is it biology this time?
-Wait, where did you get that?

00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:00.153
When I was in the US,

00:38:00.237 --> 00:38:02.864
I met an exchange professor of biology
from Hankuk University…

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:06.785
Is it necessary for me
to explain all this?

00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:07.911
No, that's good.

00:38:07.995 --> 00:38:11.623
That will naturally turn on
Gil Beauty's desire.

00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:14.292
We'll continue to stimulate
Gil Beauty's subconscious.

00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:18.672
Which will explode her desire to catch

00:38:18.755 --> 00:38:22.009
the Beautifying Toner that is unreachable.
Boom, boom, boom!

00:38:24.428 --> 00:38:26.388
ANALYSIS:
DOES NOT MATCH THE SAMPLE SUBMITTED

00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:27.305
Darn it.

00:38:28.098 --> 00:38:29.433
How can they not make it

00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:31.643
when I literally did
all the work for them?

00:38:32.144 --> 00:38:34.771
What do you mean
by stimulating her subconscious?

00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:36.023
The association effect.

00:38:36.106 --> 00:38:39.192
We'll make sure that the Beautifying Toner
stays stuck in her mind.

00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:53.165
All right.

00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:22.986
ANGEL VILLAGE

00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:29.326
ANGEL VILLAGE

00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:30.619
My goodness.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.263
BEAUTIFYING AND PURE TONER
NOW WITH MYSTIQUE

00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:53.308
BEAUTIFYING TONER

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.227
BEAUTIFYING TONER

00:39:56.103 --> 00:39:57.562
BEAUTIFYING TONER

00:39:59.022 --> 00:40:00.148
Here.

00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.595
NEWLY OPENED 24-HOUR
ANGEL BATH SAUNA

00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:33.640
We'll keep reminding her of it.

00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:36.017
Then, when the time comes, poke!

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:39.396
We'll poke her, and it's game over.

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:40.689
Ms. Gil,

00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:44.651
these dirty bastards are making a fuss
in Eun-seol's house.

00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:47.237
Her house has turned into a mess.

00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:50.574
Come now and help Eun-seol,
or do something.

00:40:55.287 --> 00:40:56.121
Secretary Choi!

00:40:57.164 --> 00:40:57.998
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:00.250
Drive.

00:41:01.168 --> 00:41:02.377
Where are we going?

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:18.643
-No!
-No!

00:41:18.727 --> 00:41:20.520
Wait! Hey, stop there!

00:41:20.604 --> 00:41:23.064
Wait. Stop.

00:41:24.274 --> 00:41:26.193
Eun-seol, are you okay?

00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:31.072
What are you doing on her land?

00:41:39.247 --> 00:41:40.081
"On her land?"

00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:43.376
Yes. Her land.

00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:45.212
What the…

00:41:47.297 --> 00:41:49.799
She failed to pay off her father's debt,

00:41:49.883 --> 00:41:53.887
so it's my land now.
Watch what you say, lady.

00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:58.808
He's right. I'm doomed.

00:41:58.892 --> 00:42:01.561
I thought you finally found a way
to move on,

00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:03.897
but your father's tying you down again.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.614
Look. Here. Read it.

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:13.990
TRANSFER OF COLLATERAL CONTRACT

00:42:17.786 --> 00:42:18.787
Let's get moving.

00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:42.936
I will buy your land.

00:42:44.187 --> 00:42:46.940
How much is it?
How much is it to buy this land?

00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:49.067
Four billion won.

00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:51.486
How about 3.5 billion won?

00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:55.115
You've got to be kidding me.

00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:12.299
Four billion won it is.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.765
I say 4.5 billion won.

00:43:21.725 --> 00:43:23.018
What? Why the sudden change?

00:43:28.732 --> 00:43:29.899
Stop!

00:43:33.236 --> 00:43:35.488
-Please.
-Okay, fine!

00:43:35.572 --> 00:43:37.407
Okay, 4.5 billion won!

00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:54.424
Where do you want me to sign?

00:44:03.308 --> 00:44:04.768
CHARPENTIER COLLABORATION CONTRACT

00:44:11.024 --> 00:44:14.110
There was no reason to delay,
so I rushed to sign this contract.

00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:20.784
The composition of the product
is excellent. I love it.

00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:23.870
I'm glad you like it. It's an honor.

00:44:26.915 --> 00:44:27.832
About time.

00:44:29.334 --> 00:44:30.377
Thank you so much.

00:44:43.223 --> 00:44:44.057
Thank you.

00:44:54.943 --> 00:44:56.319
Yes, Reporter Han.

00:44:57.404 --> 00:44:59.072
I'll have Secretary Choi send it to you.

00:44:59.155 --> 00:45:00.615
Please take good care of it.

00:45:01.408 --> 00:45:02.367
Bye.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.122
Send Reporter Han the draft of the article
and get my car ready.

00:45:07.205 --> 00:45:08.248
Yes, ma'am.

00:45:12.502 --> 00:45:15.880
Eun-seol, I'll be there in an hour.

00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:17.632
Make sure to pack your stuff.

00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:20.718
I've found a very decent place
for you to stay

00:45:20.802 --> 00:45:24.264
while you teach me your secrets.
So don't worry about anything.

00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:26.850
How can I ever repay you?

00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:28.476
You don't have to say that.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.311
See you soon.

00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:34.899
Repay me, my foot.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.116
What should my article title be?

00:45:43.658 --> 00:45:48.788
"Perfectly demonstrating the natural toner
passed down from the Joseon Dynasty

00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:51.624
and presenting it to the global market."

00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:55.336
"CEO of Mystique, Gil Beauty,

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.673
enters the global market."

00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:14.731
Eun-seol.

00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:16.566
I'm here.

00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:19.694
Eun-seol!

00:46:22.864 --> 00:46:24.073
I'm here.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:34.751
Wait a minute.

00:46:36.669 --> 00:46:39.214
What are you doing?

00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:42.634
As you can see, it's the undrinkable sign.

00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:44.052
What?

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:46.137
WARNING
TEST RESULT: UNDRINKABLE

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:47.722
Then…

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.726
The face.
Is it okay to apply it to the face?

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:53.937
What? That's dangerous.

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.647
There's a closed mine nearby,

00:46:56.231 --> 00:47:00.568
so it's full of elements like arsenic,
cadmium, zinc, nickel, copper, and lead.

00:47:01.903 --> 00:47:03.988
No, that's impossible.

00:47:04.489 --> 00:47:06.407
Until recently… Wait.

00:47:19.295 --> 00:47:20.880
How can this happen just overnight?

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.633
This place used to have clean water.

00:47:24.676 --> 00:47:26.427
With Manbaeksan Mountain in the center,

00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:30.223
there was natural sparkling water
in all four directions.

00:47:30.723 --> 00:47:33.518
So even King Sejo… Where did she go?

00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:36.896
You know, King Sejo, who said,
"Do I look like I'll be the king?"

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.981
Let's say I know it.

00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:40.775
He often visited here
to cure his skin problems.

00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:47.574
So?

00:47:47.657 --> 00:47:50.451
He used to come here
to treat his skin problems.

00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:54.539
So, Sambong Mineral Spring in the north,
Songcheon Mineral Spring in the east,

00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:58.293
and Bangadari in the south
all used to be famous.

00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:00.503
But only a few people
knew about the mineral spring

00:48:00.587 --> 00:48:01.921
in Keunhani Village in the west.

00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:03.923
Yes, Keunhani Village.

00:48:04.007 --> 00:48:06.301
Keunhani Village
because of the major grudge.

00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:08.636
Jageunhani Village
because of the minor grudge.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.015
No, it's major coldness
and minor coldness.

00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:14.475
Dahan and Sohan.
It doesn't mean anything else.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.394
Then,

00:48:17.854 --> 00:48:19.314
what about the villagers who live here?

00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:22.191
It's been quite a while
since anyone lived here.

00:48:22.775 --> 00:48:23.610
What?

00:48:23.693 --> 00:48:28.239
Oh, there was a crowd recently
to film a movie or something.

00:48:35.872 --> 00:48:38.374
Then, do you know Choi Eun-seol?

00:48:38.458 --> 00:48:40.960
Of course, I do.
Everyone here knows Eun-seol.

00:48:41.044 --> 00:48:42.587
Where is she now?

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:46.257
You'll find her
at Manjeongsa Temple down there.

00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:49.719
Manjeongsa Temple.

00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:54.474
Everyone.

00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:56.559
The village you see over there
is Keunhani Village.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.936
Why are the villages named that way?

00:48:59.604 --> 00:49:00.813
It's actually nothing special.

00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:04.233
This place has long been known
for its cold climate.

00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:09.030
But nowadays, the weather is very warm.

00:49:09.113 --> 00:49:12.742
We're getting abnormal temperatures
due to global warming. The world is…

00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:14.827
Where's Choi Eun-seol right now?

00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:17.080
Hey, Eun-seol.

00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:19.666
Someone's looking for you.

00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:21.459
I'm Choi Eun-seol.

00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:24.462
MANBAEKSAN NATIONAL PARK
CHOI EUN-SEOL

00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:25.630
KIM JIN-MAN

00:49:26.923 --> 00:49:28.007
I'm Kim Jin-man.

00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:33.930
Now, it's time for the activity that is
only available at Manjeongsa Temple.

00:49:34.013 --> 00:49:36.557
-You all know what it is, right?
-Activity?

00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:37.975
We'll start it soon.

00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:40.395
If you applied for it, you can follow me.

00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:46.401
Today, we will make a handmade toner

00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:49.779
with wild mountain herbs from nature.

00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:51.989
Handmade toner with wild mountain herbs?

00:49:54.575 --> 00:49:59.330
Lastly, I have prepared different kinds
of natural essential oils here.

00:49:59.414 --> 00:50:02.834
Choose the scent and the effect you'd like
and add a drop or two.

00:50:03.376 --> 00:50:04.836
Maybe I'll use the magnolia oil.

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:08.673
MAGNOLIA OIL

00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:14.804
The added magnolia oil
gives it a luxurious, long-lasting aroma.

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.184
I was fooled.

00:50:26.607 --> 00:50:28.276
-What's wrong with her?
-What is her problem?

00:50:29.777 --> 00:50:32.572
The number does not exist.

00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:34.949
-Please check and dial again.
-How dare you…

00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:36.367
How dare you make a fool of me?

00:50:45.293 --> 00:50:46.127
Secretary Choi.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:50.131
Call Charpentier and tell them to postpone
the collaboration product release

00:50:50.214 --> 00:50:51.799
due to some internal affairs.

00:50:51.883 --> 00:50:52.717
What?

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.220
Ms. Gil, is something wrong?

00:50:56.304 --> 00:50:57.680
It's a long story!

00:50:57.764 --> 00:50:59.849
-I'll tell you in person.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:51:02.977 --> 00:51:04.395
MAGNOLIA FLOWER DINER

00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:10.443
Magnolia flowers?

00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:12.195
Seriously, you punks!

00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:26.626
SECRETARY CHOI

00:51:30.213 --> 00:51:31.172
Where is it?

00:51:36.844 --> 00:51:39.055
Secretary Choi, how did it go?

00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.224
Ms. Gil, what do we do?

00:51:41.933 --> 00:51:42.767
What?

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.311
I just called Charpentier.

00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:49.232
They said it is true that they sent
a document on the collaboration project,

00:51:49.315 --> 00:51:53.861
but they never sent a person to Korea,
or signed the contract.

00:51:54.362 --> 00:51:55.321
What?

00:51:58.282 --> 00:51:59.116
Here it is.

00:52:01.994 --> 00:52:04.413
It's called Keunhani for major coldness,

00:52:04.497 --> 00:52:09.836
and the other village on that mountain
is called Jageunhani for minor coldness.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:13.548
First, this is the base of the toner.

00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:18.219
The toners out in the market
use purified water,

00:52:18.302 --> 00:52:22.348
but here, we're going to use
the clean natural water

00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:24.392
that flows behind Manjeongsa Temple.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.318
MYSTIQUE CEO
GIL BEAUTY

00:52:36.529 --> 00:52:37.655
Thank you. It's perfect.

00:52:41.993 --> 00:52:45.288
Was that fake, too?

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.840
MS. GIL! YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!

00:52:59.594 --> 00:53:00.970
As I have announced,

00:53:01.053 --> 00:53:04.682
I turned on the camera
to deliver you an important message today.

00:53:04.765 --> 00:53:05.641
What the hell is this?

00:53:05.725 --> 00:53:08.728
I'll invite two former Mystique employees
and listen to their stories.

00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:14.358
When the lawsuit began,

00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:17.361
I was instructed to falsify the documents

00:53:17.445 --> 00:53:19.906
by replacing the allergenic ingredient

00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:22.116
with an expensive, eco-friendly one.

00:53:23.326 --> 00:53:24.493
Who instructed you?

00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:27.163
It was Ms. Gil Beauty's order.

00:53:28.873 --> 00:53:31.834
I might be sued for false accusations
if I spoke with no evidence.

00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:36.005
So I prepared a recording of Gil Beauty.

00:53:42.178 --> 00:53:44.972
Discard the original ingredient label
and replace it with this.

00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:47.266
Remove idroxenon in all products.

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.518
And sue that witch for false accusations.

00:53:49.602 --> 00:53:51.646
How dare this delusional bitch sue me?

00:53:52.146 --> 00:53:53.314
What the hell is this?

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:54.899
How did it get released…

00:53:57.652 --> 00:53:58.819
Was it Secretary Choi?

00:54:01.614 --> 00:54:02.448
Her phone…

00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:05.159
I'll help you with the charging.

00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:15.544
Those darn bastards!

00:54:20.925 --> 00:54:21.759
You really had to…

00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:25.888
You fucking bastards!

00:54:38.442 --> 00:54:40.152
She got what she deserved.

00:54:40.236 --> 00:54:43.197
We can't let these villains
just die and go to hell.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.366
We have to give them
a taste of hell in this life.

00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:47.535
I bet Gil Beauty feels like
she's in hell right now.

00:54:48.035 --> 00:54:50.705
No, something even worse
is waiting for her.

00:54:51.497 --> 00:54:52.832
The hell of lawsuits

00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:55.209
and the hell of criticism
by the whole nation

00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:57.420
that Lee Hye-yun had to endure
for five years.

00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:08.556
Excuse me!

00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:14.937
-Lady! We're here!
-What?

00:55:15.688 --> 00:55:16.731
-What?
-Get off!

00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:20.234
-I said we're here!
-What? We're here already?

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.821
-Hurry and get off the bus.
-I will.

00:55:23.904 --> 00:55:25.656
-Hurry up.
-I am!

00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:27.867
Jeez.

00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:36.167
CHECK WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.084
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS

00:55:37.168 --> 00:55:38.002
What?

00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:39.670
Nothing?

00:55:39.754 --> 00:55:40.880
Is it empty?

00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:43.257
What the heck?

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.134
Gosh, I can't even.

00:55:45.217 --> 00:55:46.886
Darn it.

00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:49.221
For goodness' sake.

00:55:58.731 --> 00:55:59.565
What…

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:01.358
What the…

00:56:03.736 --> 00:56:04.820
Mom!

00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:08.074
This lady is over there and here, too.

00:56:09.992 --> 00:56:11.952
FINANCIAL CRIMINAL
WANTED FOR FRAUD

00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:14.580
Darn it.

00:56:16.248 --> 00:56:17.500
Too bad.

00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:18.459
Darn it.

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:21.087
The hell called prison
is also waiting for her.

00:56:22.588 --> 00:56:25.007
What? What are you looking at?

00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:26.634
Darn it.

00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:31.013
Yes, I'm Gil Beauty!

00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:36.769
Yes, the octopus over there.
In the center.

00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:40.064
Hey, what's up? Mr. Ray-Bang.

00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:42.233
-Hi.
-Snacks for games.

00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:45.778
I know I always find the perfect timing.

00:56:45.861 --> 00:56:47.905
-Where's Gu-ho?
-Go ahead without me.

00:56:47.988 --> 00:56:50.324
I still have a few more sets to go.

00:56:52.868 --> 00:56:53.702
About what I said?

00:56:55.454 --> 00:56:58.124
Here you are.
It took me a while to find it.

00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:00.167
Thanks, Mr. Ray-Bang.

00:57:02.002 --> 00:57:05.005
Now, let me hit some iron.

00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:11.720
Do you think the culprit would be
interested in Yu Kang-il's painting?

00:57:14.557 --> 00:57:16.183
He's guaranteed to…

00:57:21.105 --> 00:57:23.774
I need a trophy to celebrate…

00:57:27.153 --> 00:57:29.196
my perfect victory.

00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:49.717
Yu Kang-il's painting disappeared
from the scene of your kidnapping.

00:57:52.303 --> 00:57:56.223
And he's the one who recently purchased
that painting from the black market?

00:57:57.558 --> 00:57:59.768
So? Do you think he's the culprit?

00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:08.736
Anyway, when are you going to tell him?

00:58:10.279 --> 00:58:11.113
Tell him what?

00:58:13.741 --> 00:58:15.826
It's about time Gu-ho learned the truth.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:41.435
HA JUNG-HO

00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:47.418
A cafe that filmmakers love?

00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:48.877
Is this your first time at our cafe?

00:59:49.878 --> 00:59:51.714
He replaced labels
on imported and farmed products

00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:53.924
with ones claiming
they were domestic and wild,

00:59:54.008 --> 00:59:56.635
and he amassed enormous wealth.

00:59:57.469 --> 01:00:02.224
Cinema is an unfulfilled dream
for Ha Jung-ho.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:06.103
We're aiming for our movie
to reach ten million viewers.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.814
This is truly amazing.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.733
Are you interested
in investing in our movie?

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:14.611
I'm thinking of having
a little fling with him.
