[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.290
Prince Yan, are you growing roots
at Zhou's Mansion?

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.270
Why are you always here?

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.400
Ever since you decided
to return to Zhou's Mansion,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.530
I've been restless.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.830
So,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.340
after much consideration,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.550
I had to ask Father

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.580
for an imperial decree of marriage.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.120
With you as my future princess consort,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.450
I can protect you fully.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.790
I never expected

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.090
to arrive just in time
for this forced marriage drama.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.870
I should have known all along
that Zhou Kui's

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.440
sudden move to make me
the Zhou familyâ€™s principal daughter

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.700
couldn't be so simple.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.430
But I didn't expect

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.660
he would use this marriage to challenge me

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.510
and make me his stepping stone.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.039
That's perfect then.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.289
By a twist of fate...

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.480
It worked in my favor.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.800
Fu Wei.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.660
Are you ready
to become my princess consort?

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.380
Yan.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.660
Why do you have gray hair?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.150
It's nothing.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.579
People

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.460

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.490
Let's think about

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.700
our wedding.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.280
About our wedding,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.660
the betrothal gifts,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.000
the wedding wine,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.690
and your wedding dress -

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.510
nothing can be overlooked.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.760
And also...

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.770
Let me think...

[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.720
Prince Yan, please wait.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.260
Li Yan,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.740
I command you to stop.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.430
Crown Princess,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.620
what can I do for you?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.750
Do you hate me that much?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.600
You should know

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.860
everything I've done

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.430
was beyond my control.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.690
Beyond your control?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.930
No matter how much
it was beyond your control,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.450
you shouldn't have warmed yourself
with others' blood.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.270
It seems

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.020
he knows I'm the real Zhou Ruoxi.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.270
You're absolutely right.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.940
But you should understand

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.430
that it is I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080
who am now the Princess of Daqing.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.780
The position of Crown Princess

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.450
is also mine.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.580
Please help me pick it up.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.440
I said,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.000
please help me pick it up.

[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.340
Thank you, Prince Yan.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.180
How did the Eastern Palace token

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.650
end up in her hands?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.690
What is she planning to do?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.240
Mother died tragically
because of the loan sharking case.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.300
In Zhou's Mansion,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.020
there's evidence
of Father's corruption and graft.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.970
It seems Father was the mastermind
behind the loan sharking case.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.400
But Cui Yuan'an came
to assassinate the Crown Prince,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.130
claiming with certainty that he was
behind the loan sharking case.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.130
No matter who it is,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.290
I must find out the truth

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.830
and avenge my mother.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.430
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.760
I remember my brother

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
once sent someone
with the Eastern Palace token

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.650
to investigate
troop stockpiling in the black market.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.350
After that, the spies
who were sent went missing,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.870
so the matter was dropped.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.550
Your Highness.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.820
The token you asked me to investigate

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.659
was last seen in the black market.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:56.720
It was mainly involved in

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.720
arms and ordnance transportation.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.280
The black market again.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.640
The money confiscated

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.740
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.600
has huge discrepancies
with what's recorded in the ledger.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.680
The final lead

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.360
also ends at the black market.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.420
Could all this money

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.850
have been used
to secretly stockpile arms and ordnance?

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.070
Could it be as Fu Wei suspects,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.080
that the one who has dealings
with the Daqing royal family

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.310
and manipulates everything
behind the scenes

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.460
is my brother?

Arms and ordnance transportation.

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.520
What exactly is he planning to do?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.360
Rebellion.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.030
The Crown Prince is planning a rebellion.

Get out.

The door is there.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.409
Get out.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.240
Yes.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.670
Shu is already the future heir.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.510
He would never commit treason.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.480
Who is it that schemes with such intent,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.130
controlling everything from the shadows?

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960
Master.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.600
I wonder what orders you have
in summoning me here

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600
at this late hour.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.180
Lord Zhou?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.200
Find an opportunity

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.520
to enter the palace

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.450
and meet with that person inside

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.770
to retrieve something for me.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.740
Yes.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.160
Master.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.020

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.000
Why aren't you
helping me change my clothes?

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.840
I'm going to the palace today.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.980
Crown Princess,

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.600
come with me.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.290
Previously,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.570
I misunderstood you.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.700
Please forgive me.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.510
As for you,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.210
you've been married into
the Eastern Palace for some time now.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.870
You should pay respects
to the royal ladies in the palace,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.000
otherwise it would be disrespectful.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.360
I will

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.510
prepare right away.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.000
For now,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.230
I can only make good use of her,
the substitute,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.880
and find clues through her.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.490
His Majesty has invited the Crown Prince
and Prince Yan for a meeting.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.220
Miss Zhou Ruoxi, you may wait here.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.860
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.290
Your Highness.

Li Shu.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.750
If all this is related to you,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.130
I won't let you get away with it.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.910
Your Majesty.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.400
The Crown Prince is here.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.400
Father.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.130
Where is the Crown Princess?

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.010
She brought some gifts

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.430
and went to pay respects
to the ladies in the inner palace.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.860
You two were recently married.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.430
Are you getting along well?

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.690
It's a marriage bestowed by you, Father.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.410
And it's an alliance
between two countries.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.840
I will certainly treat the Crown Princess

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.280
with the utmost care and affection.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.400
You're husband and wife,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.800
and newlyweds at that.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.520
Why speak so distantly?

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.550
I summoned you to the palace today

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.280
to discuss

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.020
your brother's marriage.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.240
Shu.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.090
Father

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.750
has arranged my marriage
to Miss Zhou Ruoxi,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.670
and we will be married soon.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.910
I hope you will

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.380
find time to attend our wedding.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.750
Miss Zhou Ruoxi?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.160
Yes.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.840
Wasn't Yan

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.840
in love with Princess Fu Wei before?

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.480
Why did he agree
to this marriage so readily?

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.670
Marrying Miss Zhou Ruoxi

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.250
is Father's decree.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.650
This is my duty as his subject.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.640
Yan.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.200
Yes,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.820
Father.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.920
I previously

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.520
arranged for the Princess of Daqing

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.240
to marry your brother.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.900
I know you were upset about it.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.520
But now

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.100
you have someone you care for too.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.900
From now on, there should be

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.420
no more conflicts
between you brothers over such matters.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.250
Shu.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.370
You must attend

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.890
Yan's wedding ceremony

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.100
to add to your brother's happiness.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.740
Rest assured, Father.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.330
I will certainly give Yan

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.800
a grand gift.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.960
Linglan?

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.230
Here's what His Highness requested.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.510
Our path has been cut off.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.790
We had no choice but to ask for your help.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.880
His Highness?

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.700
Fu Wei.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.800
Father has agreed
to attend the wedding ceremony.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.400
I believe on our wedding day,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.500
it will be extremely lively.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.020
What's the matter?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.180
Is there something wrong?

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.380
If there's anything,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.780
you can't hide it from me.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.490
I just can't figure some things out.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.590
What about you?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.280
Are you hiding anything from me?

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.190
What could I possibly hide from you?

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.320
You know

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.780
more than anyone else here.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.880
What's the price of extending life
with the Seven-Star Lamp?

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.630
Did you use your own lifespan

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.280
to extend mine?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.250
Thank you, Doctor, for extending my life.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.200
There's something I don't understand.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.200
What is the price of extending life
with the Seven-Star Lamp?

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.120
Does it

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.000
harm others?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.920
Everything

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.120
has its price.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.160
To gain something,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.490
something must be lost.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.310
Is there any way to undo it?

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.920
I don't want Prince Yan
to sacrifice for me.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.450
What can I do?

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.310
I'm willing to pay any price.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.960
There is no way to reverse it.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:07.650
Miss,

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.780
live in the present

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.790
and cherish who you have now.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.540
Fu Wei.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.830
I have something to tell you.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.070
Wonton!

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.620
Noodle soup!

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.640
Candied haws!

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.560
Hya!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.360
Hya!

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.540
Where are you taking me?

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.460
I've got something new

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.970
that I want to show you.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.200
Right here.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.460
Look.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.310
One easily knows
the face of the east wind;

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.470
In a thousand shades of purple and red,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.350
all is spring.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.410
Green trees cast deep shade
as summer days grow long;

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.330
Pavilions reflect their forms

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.360
within the pond.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.960
Maple leaves turn
the mountains crimson bright;

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.040
Yellow blossoms

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.640
endure the evening breeze.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.640
Who plays the flute
in heaven, none can tell;

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.740
Snowflakes drift

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.850
and blanket all the world.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.250
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.850
each season holds its charm.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280
But without you,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.780
everything loses its luster.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.530
Between us,

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.860
let's not speak of debts.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.680
Of all things in this world,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.290
as long as we're together,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.120
that alone

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.160
is enough.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.040
Linglan?

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.109
She isn't serving the Crown Princess

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.369
but has come to Zhou's Mansionâ€”what for?

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.790
[Pass for the Military Supply Route]

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.470
Military Supply Route?

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.590
This is what His Highness requested.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.350
What do they need this pass for?

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.440
Don't move.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.080
Linglan,

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.050
whose side are you really on?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.090
Since you're here,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.890
why not meet me openly,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.960
Princess Fu Wei?
