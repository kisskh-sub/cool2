[Episode 7]

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.710
Who is it?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.229
It's me,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.920
Qin Shishan.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.560
Shishan?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.740
How do you know I live here?

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.690
Many truck drivers live in this area.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.590
Besides, you're very famous, Mr. Zhen.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.360
It's easy to locate you.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.620
Stop making fun of me. Let's talk inside.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.430
What's going on here?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.430
I love spicy food.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.960
What a good daughter you have.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.090
Such heavy smoke. I'll close the door.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.350
Does she wear B-cup bras now?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.370
Shishan,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.870
please don't joke about my kid.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.430
I'm not.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.079
Make way.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.280
Dinner's ready.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.150
Hurry.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.710
Shishan, let me get you some tea.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.710
I have Tie Guan Yin,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.240
Cassie Bark Oolong and Da Hong Pao.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.310
Which would you like?

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.710
No need. I'm good.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.810
Mr. Zhen,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.960
I've looked around,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.800
but found no photo
of you and your daughter.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.730
I look back, especially on camera.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.580
Kids grow up fast.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.370
Cherish your time with her.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.110
Yeah, sure.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.150
Does your daughter live here too?

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.610
Sometimes she stays over.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.470
Nothing much to see here.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.280
Come have tea.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.520
Come on!

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.770
No need for tea.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.560
Mr. Liu

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.870
has a gift for you.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.990
A gift?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.470
How generous of Mr. Liu.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.410
It's a watch! I love it.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.590
Mr. Liu usually has others
set their watches

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.650
by him before carrying out missions.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.680
Pretty.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.340
Quite nice.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.240
Alright. I've made the delivery. See you.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.630
Let's have dinner together.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.630
I can't eat that.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.520
Please stay.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.400

[Attached with
a sketch of the suspect Mou X]

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.030
Now you know why he rents two places,
right?

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.560
He's worried

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.090
that someone might suddenly
search his room.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.930
That's a valid concern.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.320
He has to be thorough.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.800
If anything happens to him,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.000
at least there will be clues left for us.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.210
His life is constantly at stake.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.310
These years have been rough for him.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.310
What a fool he is.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.430
He has to hold out in suffering.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.560
Put the things back.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.310
I blame that hateful man

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.000
for barging in and disrupting me.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.510
I could've cooked this better.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.480
It's okay.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.850
I'll fix it.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.240
Your mother has gone back to her hometown.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.680
You'd better behave.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.470
I think you're the one who's not behaving.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.670
They gave you a watch.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.350
I'm sure you're up to no good.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.630
Boss.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.250
Is the man Mr. Liu recruited reliable?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.220
I'm observing him.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.800
A girl came out of nowhere,
alleged to be his daughter.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.130
I've never heard of her.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.159
Text me her name.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.270
Okay.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.950
You'll sleep in the room tonight.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.480
Then...

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.920
where will you sleep?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.600
The couch.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.730
Get in the room.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.510
It seems
I don't have their complete trust yet.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.640
For safety reasons,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.730
you must leave tomorrow morning.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.650
I'm sorry.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.010
Today,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.070
I caused you trouble.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.400
It wasn't trouble at all.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.980
Your mother still hates me,
doesn't she?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.780
She even wouldn't let others
mention your name.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.180
She gets mad at anyone who speaks of you.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.750
I understand.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.700
Do you really understand?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.450
In fact, I resented you a bit back then.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.510
But my mother said,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.610
as the family of a narcotics officer,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.380
we had to brace ourselves
for losing our loved one anytime.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.240
For the good of his young comrade-in-arms,

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.390
my father's sacrifice was worth it.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.250
I couldn't fully understand it
at that time.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.840
But now,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.890
being a narcotics officer myself,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.670
I finally do.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.860
Lives are bound to be sacrificed
in battle.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.390
In that particular fight...

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.580
The misfortune befell my father.

[In mourning of the passing
of Comrade Wu Jianguo]

Captain Wu

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.490
sacrificed his life for me.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.840
It wasn't for anyone.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.150
I believe if you had been in his position,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.150
you would have made the same choice.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.750
My father was a hero,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.320
[In loving memory of Wu Jianguo]

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.780
and so are you, Uncle Yang.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.030
I should apologize to you.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.920
I'd hate for my recklessness

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.770
to put you in danger as well.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.910
That would really upset me.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.600
When I saw you
at the hot pot restaurant today,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.080
I knew

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.930
you must've been through much suffering
in the past 3 years.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.100
Uncle Yang,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
when you have time,
I hope you can come by my home

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.750
for fried stuffed pancakes.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.230
My mother's cooking is the same as ever.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.040
Captain Wu,

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.600
I, Yang Yipeng, a narcotics officer,
am reporting for duty.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.610
My wife made these for you.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.340
Try some.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.250
Fried stuffed pancakes. My favorite.

Captain Wu!

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.440
Tasty, huh?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:27.790
Very tasty.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.480
Captain Wu!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.540
There's a new task.

We have to go now?

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.000
Yes.

Let's go.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.270

Yang Shu does have a daughter

named Yang Ying.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.920
But I haven't been able to
get in contact with his ex-wife.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.320
What should I do next?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.360
Just follow the routine.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.200
We need someone to threaten him with,
don't we?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960
Okay. Got it.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.150
I'm really getting old.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.320
Can't believe I just fell asleep.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.000
You hadn't slept for 2 days.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.560
Oh, right.

Last night,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.840
I already added a daughter to his profile.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.660
Good.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.650
It's time to eat!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.980
What now?

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.750
I just woke up.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.320
What are we eating?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.030
Get ready to take action.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.480
Okay.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.940
I wonder if there's breakfast for us.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.720
You wish.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.240
Even cats and dogs
won't eat your terrible cooking.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240
Then don't eat it.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.240
But I'm hungry.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.440
-Then shut up and eat.
-You got everything ready?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.960
If you hadn't used my credit
to take out loans online,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.870
you think I would've come here?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.440
-Give me the money,
-Yes.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.570
and I'll be on my way.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.540
Prepare to take action.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.090
What's that?

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.270
Are you still using drugs?

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.110
-What are you doing? Get off me!
-Are you still using drugs?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.600
Hands off!

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.510
Where did you hide it?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.510
I'm telling you to get off me!

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.680
Where did you hide it?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.840
Are you going to break my stuff?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.670
You bet I am!

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.000
What can you do about it?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.300
What do you think you're doing?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.360
I raised you, ungrateful brat!

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.600

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.290
Why are you still so mad?

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.110
Calm down and talk it through.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.550
How am I supposed to calm down?

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.350
Liu Bingqiang

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.630
dropped me halfway—
I'll let that slide.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.030
But where is my daughter?

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.780
It's just the standard procedure.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.880
Be patient.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.810
Your daughter will be sent back
once the work is done.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.130
Cut the crap! I'm telling you,

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.320
Liu Bingqiang's son

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.800
obviously has evil thoughts

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.860
about my daughter.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.970
Listen,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.550
tell me where my daughter is,

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.270
or I'll come fight you now!

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.230
Mr. Zhen,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.630
no need for such tension.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.150
I'll ask them right away.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.490
I'll call you again in 10 minutes.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.020
Here it is.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.590
Get off the truck.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.420
Hand over your phones.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.770
You'll get them back when the work's done.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:03.800
Hurry.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.360
Yours?

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.100
Go, start working.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.510
Got a phone on you?

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.450
Where's your phone?

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.090
Hurry up.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.600
Can you pause and explain this?

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.480
We're almost there.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.320
Slowly.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.670
Be careful.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.600
What exactly are we transferring?

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.760
Don't be so nosy.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.190
Get a move on.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.150
Or they'll yell at us again.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.930
Be quick!

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.000
Go!

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.200
Let's go!

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.050
Keep moving. Why the dawdling?

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.630
One delivery every 30 minutes.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.830
Two barrels per trip.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.160
Very impressive.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.280
Members of this Xinji tour group

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.540
are all over the place.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.330
They're our human shields.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.510
When the final products are out,

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.800
we'll still need your help, Mr. Liu.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800
No problem.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.070
Be quick!

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.780
Gu Zhifeng.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.810
Gu Zhifeng.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.510
Chief Cheng,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.270
I'm here.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.800
Lead your team to set up

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.200
checkpoints at the east and west ends
of the North Beach Road.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.200
For what?

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.450
We're assisting
the Narcotics Control Brigade tonight.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.350
Chief Fang

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.650
will tell you the specifics later.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:35.880
Got it.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.840
To the North Beach Road.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.470
[Police]

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.770
[Public Security]

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.550
Come on.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.480
What song would you like to sing?

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.810
I need to use the toilet.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.520
Didn't you just go?

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.670
I have bad kidneys, alright?

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.730
Bad kidneys...

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.070
You're going to watch me use the toilet?

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.330
Don't pull any stunts.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.640
Qin.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.430
Run. Something happened!
