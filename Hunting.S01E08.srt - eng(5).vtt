[Drug cookX] [Liu Bingqiang]

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.220
According to Qin Shishan,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.750
the person Liu Libo and his gang kidnapped

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.550
was Mou Haidong's son, Mou Lang.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.750
The female suspect
who participated in the kidnapping

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.930
at that time

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.130
was known to everyone as Xiaomin.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.270
Her real name is unknown.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:07.680
She is

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.990
Liu Libo's mistress.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.130
Did Qin Shishan
have any contact with the drug cook?

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.680
Qin Shishan stated that

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.440
Liu Libo had always been in contact
with the drug cook

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.680
through a single channel.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.480
But 3 years ago,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.720
after that batch
of pink meth was destroyed,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.250
the drug cook approached Liu Libo

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.610
and they specifically planned

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.310
to use the newly made pink meth

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.600
to repay their debts.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.020
But Liu Libo

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.030
has always been extremely cautious

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.110
and wouldn't let anyone get close.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.720
So Qin Shishan has never seen

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.880
the drug cook's true identity.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.300
The test results are in.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.510
From the existing samples,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.830
the semi-finished products
at the beach drug-making site

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.440
appear to have a higher purity
than the pink meth

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.440
found in the previous cans.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:43.960
Additionally,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.270
according to the DNA test

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.000
from the gas mask,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.400
the match with Mou Haidong's DNA

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.790
is over 99%.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.640
If the drug cook

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.030
is Mou Haidong's son,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.880
then everything

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.840
makes sense now.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.110
But our records show

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.640
that Mou Haidong only has one son.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.170
So he must be
Mou Haidong's illegitimate son.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.960
He remains our primary arrest target.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.020
We weren't successful this time.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.160
However,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.630
Mou Lang

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.390
is still in Liu Libo's hands.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.470
He will definitely keep trying.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.830
So our next focus

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.000
will be on Liu Libo.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.920
Everyone, carry on.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.450

but Liu Libo and Liu Bingqiang
still got away.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.500
