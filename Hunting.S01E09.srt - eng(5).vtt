[Hunting]

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.289
[Episode 9]

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.680
Duozai, why are you so late?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.009
Where have you been?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.360
Nothing.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.030
You...

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.630
He just collapsed on the ground, you know?

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.870
I was terrified.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.280
I'll go check on him.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.190
It's okay. I just...

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.520
I just stopped his bleeding.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520
Why are you getting in my way?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.180
Move aside.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.840
When did you get out?

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.680
Been out for a while.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760
This pigpen boy,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.320
he's quite lucky.
He finally pulled through.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.650
Just now at the boat,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.810
I ran into your dad.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.000
What a coincidence.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.520
He was scared out of his wits.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.360
So I came over to help him.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.130
Thank goodness I ran into him!

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.810
What's that smell?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.220
Do you smell anything?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.520
Just now...

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.360
Could it be from the bandages
we just changed?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.960
Yes, we changed the bandages.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.470
It's alcohol and that sort of thing...

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.670
To stop his bleeding.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.360
Right.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.450
How do you feel?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.590
Let me explain to you.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.560
Where did it come from?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.000
That's...

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.750
Mr. Zhen.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.180
From that burned car,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.360
he salvaged a few packages.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.200
I only took two cans, you know.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.280
Because of this stuff,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.030
we got into so much trouble.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.630
Don't you know that?

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.680
If I hadn't brought it, he would've...

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.010
Are you tired of living?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.030
Canned Braised Pork.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.110
They were produced

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.620
on June 14, 2006.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.310
[June 14, 2006]

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.240
How did you know?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.190
Because they are mine.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.400
So it was you

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.760
who stole my goods.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.030
Didn't you say everything had been ruined?

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.070
So you were the one who attacked me
at the old shipyard.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.540
I just wanted to get my goods back.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.390
Just now,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.120
I saved you.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.070
Right?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.159
Not only did I save you,

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.650
I also rescued

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.360
two cans of goods.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.600
Those two cans were rescued by me,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.390
right?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.310
Two cans.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.040
You just took back two cans.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.090
So you were the one
running the drug lab by the sea?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.270
So,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.010
are you gonna report me?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.480
You secretly made drugs.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.360
And you had us transport the stuff.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.930
You deliberately dragged us into this,
didn't you?

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.780
I used to have a glimmer of hope.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.120
I once hoped you were a good person.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.670
A good person?

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.430
What is a good person anyway?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.600
Are you morally good people?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.550
You stole other people's stuff,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.600
and destroyed it.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.340
You call yourselves good people?

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.120
Do you know how important

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.820
this shipment is to me?

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.000
Those goods are
worth hundreds of millions.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.460
Even if you saved my life
ten thousand times,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.910
I'd still be doomed.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.270
Do you...

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.320
Do you know what I went through as a kid?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
My mother was locked up like a beast!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.000
My father

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.240
wouldn't even let me
set foot in the ancestral hall.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.950
I know you had a terrible childhood.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.270
But you don't need to

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.390
pin all your hopes on drugs.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.590
Spare me the lecture.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.380
Now my father is in detention.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.370
My brother is in my enemy's hands.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.120
Only this shipment can save me.

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:59.470
If it were you,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.390
and this shipment were the only thing

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.250
that could save both their lives,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600
what would you do?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.960
Could you still be a good person?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600
I didn't know
about your brother's situation,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.660
but there's still a solution
to everything.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.230
There is no solution.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.210
Only this shipment can save me.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.360
When I saved you two before,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.020
I didn't want anything in return.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.830
And I believe you'd do the same for me.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.560
I just want my goods back.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.070
If you return the goods to me,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.840
I can give you a lot of money.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.070
I only have two cans left. Take them ...

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.130
Are you kidding me?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.730
This is drug trafficking.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.770
One can is enough for a 20-year sentence.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.060
Do you want to live
inside prison or outside?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.750
This is returning property
to its rightful owner.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.350
These were originally mine.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.750
Fine.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.870
We'll return your property.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.120
We have nothing to do with these things.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.630
We don't want a penny.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.510
Seriously,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.720
there are only two cans left.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.120
Here you go.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.240
Take them.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.630
Let's go.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.360
Go!

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.750
Master Du! Master Du!

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.270
Master Du!

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.790
Enough!

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.120
Master Du!

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.120
Where are the goods you promised me?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.080
I...

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:03.740
I...

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.090
The goods...

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.120
We...

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.100
We did our best.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.640
Well...

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.390
The ingredients have arrived.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.270
The cook arrived too.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.480
Everything was in progress.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.140
But then...

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.230
The police...

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.420
The police confiscated everything!

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.560
Whose fault is that?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.330
Master Du...

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.200
I...

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.260
I really did my best.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.010
Stop telling me you did your best.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.660
I've given you many chances already.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.030
Du...

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.850
Master Du...

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.500
I know...

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.030
I know it's my fault.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.800
I still have people in Nanzhou.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.100
I really do have people there.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.490
And the cook is still there too.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.930
We can continue

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.320
as soon as we find him.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:50.960
Besides,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.780
Mou Haidong's deadline
hasn't even passed yet.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.790
Please give me more time,
Master Du.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.320
I'm begging you, Master Du.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.160
In this business, we follow rules.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.750
You're out of time.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.390
But I still have...

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.250
I still have...

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.610
I...

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.220
I still have Mou Lang!

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.240
Mou Lang, the one I brought here.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.000
He's Mou Haidong's biological son!

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.320
Before he was sent to prison,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.150
he left his son a huge fortune.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.880
Master Du...

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.780
You failed to get any information

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.440
out of him before, didn't you?

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.460
I'm certain

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.100
Mou Haidong really left something for him.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.440
You're that certain?

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:33.690
Mou Lang's...

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.670
Mou Lang's half-brother

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.150
(same father, different mother),

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.780
Mou Sen,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.320
who is also the cook, told me so.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.530
He also wants Mou Haidong's inheritance.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.000
Please believe me.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.870
I really couldn't

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.690
get that kid to talk.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.270
Otherwise,
I would have told you everything.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.030
You can't even handle a kid,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.920
you useless piece of trash.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.530
If only...

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.450
If you can

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.090
get him to talk,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.180
Mou Haidong's fortune
worth hundreds of millions

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.050
will all be yours, sir.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.070
Grandpa...

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.590
Leave that kid to me.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.370
Do you have a way?

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.070
If he has the goods,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.930
I can get it out of him.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.270
Watch them closely.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.100
If Mou Lang has goods,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.450
you can survive.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.890
Thank you, thank you.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.600
Also,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.080
I'm quite interested in that cook.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.130
You need to keep in touch with him.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.910
If he can come to Xin Ji,

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.500
that would be perfect.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.030
I got it.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.750
Get in!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.560
Here are your phones.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480
Contact the cook.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.800
Thank you.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.080
Come on.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.000
Drink.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.390
Drink.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.720
Have a seat.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720
Come, take a seat.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.000
Join us!

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.390
Let's take a photo. Come on!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.450
Let's take a photo.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.720
Come on. Let's continue.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.790
Come on.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.680
Feeling sick from drinking?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.510
Want some more?

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.400
Don't be afraid.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.240
Now that you're at Xin Sheng He,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.790
no one dares to bully you.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.440
They're all my good friends.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.870
Please let me go.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.520
I could let you go,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.050
but it depends on

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.740
what you can give to me.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.920
What else do I have left?

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.360
Call your dad's lawyer,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.630
Huang Deming.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.320
Uncle Huang is a lawyer.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.520
He won't do anything beyond his duties.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.160
I have been sent abroad
to study since I was little.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.510
The crackdown three years ago
was very sudden.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.960
Dad didn't even have time
to prepare anything

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.290
before he was arrested.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.320
What could he have left for me?

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.420
Really?

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.620
He has an illegitimate son helping him.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.010
Your dad cares so much
about his reputation.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.720
How could he let an illegitimate son

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.980
inherit his property?

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.500
My dad never allowed me
to get involved with these things.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.040
He never thought about letting me
take over the family business.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.190
He said, "Son,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.630
I don't expect you to be that successful.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.640
I just want you to be happy

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.660
and live a healthy life."

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.570
He said he just wanted me
to live happily and healthily.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.000
Please don't make things hard for me.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.260
I've lost everything.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.410
Are you satisfied now?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.080
Don't be like this.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.290
I understand.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.030
For people from families like ours,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.180
health,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.360
happiness,

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.400
including freedom,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.360
all seem like luxuries.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.650
Relatives in the clan were either
arrested or fled.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.060
No one cares about me.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.820
Yes, I'm from the Mou family.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.740
I was born into the Mou family,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.950
but no one cares how I live.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.960
I finally made it back

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.000
just to see my dad one last time.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.080
Dad is all I have left.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.600
What did I do wrong?

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.120
I understand.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.670
What exactly did I do wrong?

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.550
Okay, I understand.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.870
I know. I understand.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.320
My parents

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.450
were also victims of gang infighting.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.530
I'm just like you.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.470
If my grandpa hadn't protected me,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.930
I would probably
have been the next to die.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.310
People like us

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.850
have no control over our lives.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.650
Sometimes, our lives

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.800
are worse than ordinary people's.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.650
Please let me go.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.680
I'll talk to my grandpa.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.440
Our happy life

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.440
is just ahead.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.510
Captain,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.550
stop searching.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.800
There are really only two cans.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.720
You don't even believe your dad?

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.690
Move aside.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.320
You've proved that
you aren't trustworthy
during all these years!

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.650
Do you deserve my trust?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.880
Stop searching, Duozai.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.510
If he had any,
he would have taken off long ago

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.110
and wouldn't come back to us.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.300
Let him search.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.600
He's always like this,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.850
very stubborn.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.850
Just let him search if he wants.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.060
When I saw him today, it was right there.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.280
Yes, right in there.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.420
Isn't there anything?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.270
If you don't listen to me,

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.270
hardship awaits.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.230
Get down.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.690
What are you doing?

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.770
I'll give you one last chance.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.829
I swear to heaven,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.310
if I, Ma Yong, have hidden
even one more can,

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.490
may I die a terrible death.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.670
Satisfied now?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.000
Seriously.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.240
Who's going to die a terrible death?

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.480
Me.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.310
Be more specific!

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.460
I'll get hit by a car and die.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.000
That's not harsh enough.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.190
My son will die with me.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.270
Don't drag me into this.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.870
If you want to die, die alone.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.740
It's good you admit you're my son.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.440
Uncle.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.400
If only you really had that many cans.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.320
Those are money.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.240
Aren't we on the run now?

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.030
It's when we need money the most.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.070
Why are you kicking me?

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.070
Isn't that right?

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.010
Look at the three of us now,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.310
how poor we've become.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.090
What else can we do?

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.040
This time,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.270
we've offended both the underworld
and the authorities.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.790
We definitely can't stay in
Nanzhou anymore.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.670
At this moment,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.530
it's up to me to take action.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.560
You mean you have a solution?

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.730
No.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.590
But I have connections.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400
Tomorrow at dawn,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.240
I'm going to work my contacts.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.210
I'll get you two out of here.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.030
Will you?

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:52.680
Really?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.530
Just listen to him brag.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.590
Captain,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.270
you should trust me,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.650
an experienced sailor.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.310
There seems to be someone over there.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.240
Quick, help him!

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.160
Hold on tight!

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.990
Boss!

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.920
Boss!

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.400
Are you okay?

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.350
You didn't answer my calls.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.550
How did you end up like this?

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.640
Get closer, now!

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.640
Be careful.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.210
Be careful!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.370
Haipeng.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.620
How's everything on your end?

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.500
Me, Liu Libo and Mou Lang

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.160
were taken to Xin Ji by Mr. Tang.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.220
We're okay for now.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.470
How are you all doing?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.610
Li Haipeng.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.200
Where is the cook?

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.370
Did someone from your side
leak information?

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.370
I was about to ask you the same thing.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.620
It must be someone on your side
who caused the problem.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.500
Is the cook still alive?

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.010
I don't know.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:10.990
Let me tell you something.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.680
Your sister and I are being held
by Mr. Tang at Xin Ji.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.810
If you want to save your sister,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.560
you need to bring that bastard
for an exchange.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.250
Why are you looking for him?

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.070
Listen to me carefully.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.840
If you want your sister to live,

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.760
you must bring the cook for the exchange.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.070
Do you understand?

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.840
If the cook doesn't come,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.970
everyone will die.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:34.960
Got it?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.320
Don't worry, I'll find him.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.990
[Call from Yang Min]

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.190
Hey.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.480
Just a moment.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.450
Go ahead.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.990
Are you sure Qiang has been caught?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.840
I want a clear answer.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.550
If Qiang has been caught,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.480
we won't be able to stay here
if something goes wrong.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400
Go check again.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.900
I'll wait for your update.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.790
I need to throw trash.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:34.970
Go ahead.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.870
Done.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.430
That wasn't easy.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.450
[Corner Store]

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:47.920
Hello?

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.660
Dad.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.450
I told you not to call this number.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.080
I thought you were arrested.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.920
Yang Min said you were with Zhen.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.730
I want to leave.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.440
I don't want to stay here.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.460
Don't run off.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.270
The police are looking for me.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.350
You're safe there.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.620
What should I do?

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.530
I'll make some connections
and get you out in a few days.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.070
Got it.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.570
Here's the money, sir.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.820
Hello?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.830
Forensic Technology Division
has locked the location.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.350
Liu Bingqiang should be there.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.270
Stand by for action.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.030
Copy that.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.590
Let's go. Time to work.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.960
Chen.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.550
Get the cars and weapons ready.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.170
Got it.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.380
Would you want a popsicle?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.960
What?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.700
I'll reward you with half a popsicle.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.050
Why?

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.290
Because you just threw away the trash.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.780
That's weird.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.450
Qiang.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.830
The route is all set.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.180
I'll pick up Wen later.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.590
Let's not have any problems this time.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.780
Don't worry, Qiang.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.570
Where have we ended up?

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.130
Captain Luo.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.440
Just got a notice from the police station.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.960
This is an abandoned building.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.920
No residents living nearby.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.040
That's perfect.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.280
The location is right here.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.360
Then Liu Bingqiang should be up there.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.590
The situation upstairs is unclear.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.430
Everyone, be careful later.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.680
We can shoot when necessary.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.000
Let's split into teams.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.420
Luo, which team am I leading?

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.310
Master, you stay here with Ms. Lin.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.450
I'll be in a group by myself.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.550
Why should I stay here?

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.750
I'm worried about Ms. Lin's safety.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.750
Why are you worrying about me?

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.860
My experience is no less than yours.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.680
Lin Qiong! Lin Qiong!

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.160
It's really for your own good.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.370
Then go watch the intersection

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.060
and wait for backup.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.280
Liang, come upstairs with me.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.930
Zixian, you two flank from that side.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.680
Got it.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.520
Go and check outside.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.140
Don't move.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.350
-Don't move.
-Drop the gun!

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.830
Freeze!

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.440
Don't move!

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.030
Don't move!

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.150
Liu Bingqiang!

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.440
Come here.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.160
Liu Bingqiang!

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.820
Don't move!

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.640
I'm shooting!

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.750
Liu Bingqiang.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.960
Hands up!

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.360
Handcuff him.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.510
Hands up!

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.830
Turn around.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.250
Don't move.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.120
Are you okay?

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.430
What's going on? What happened?

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.680
Nothing, Master.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.180
Why are you two drinking by yourselves?

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.560
Join us!

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.550
The four beauties!

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.720
Come on, let's drink to the four beauties!

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.250
Xi Shi, Diao Chan,
Wang Zhaojun, Yang Yuhuan!

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.210
Come on, drink up!

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.480
Are you short on supplies lately?

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.250
Need good stuff.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.650
Need quality goods?

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.940
I've got some good stuff here.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.150
Really?

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.500
How about this,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.770
you help me sell goods,

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.970
and I'll give you a 30% cut of the profit.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.200
Let me ask around.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.270
What's there to ask?

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.350
You must help me.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.750
You have to help me,
whether you ask or not!

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.010
Okay, no problem.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.160
Deal?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.160
Come on!

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.310
It's all in this drink.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.960
It's settled then.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.200
Let's drink!

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.350
-Come on.
-Cheers.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.550
Be happy!

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.960
Please ask for me, will you?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.020
I'll be right back.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.290
Take good care of them.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.400
Boss, drink up and enjoy!

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.700
What are you doing?

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.160
Why is it you?

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.180
You want to kill me too?

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.880
That's just how things are.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.270
If you don't go to Xin Ji to find Mr. Tang,

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:27.930
Liu Libo,

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.670
my sister,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.310
and your brother,

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.610
they'll all be dead.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.690
Even if I go,

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.730
can they really come back?

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.930
It'll just be two more corpses.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:43.960
Sen,

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.840
how can you say something so heartless?

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.720
Don't forget,

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.750
you're the one who dragged us into this.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.170
Let me tell you,

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.970
if anything happens to my sister,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.610
you'll be the first one I take down.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.670
Mr. Tang wants me,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.850
not your sister.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.640
You're the cook,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.150
so go cook!

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.200
Yes, I can cook.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.590
But do you have ingredients?

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.190
Do you have any ingredients?

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.610
I certainly don't.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.330
Noodles are enough.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.280
Don't need to bring me canned food.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.520
They are from the 200 kilos of goods
I made before.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.790
The Braised Pork.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.070
Where did you find them?

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.010
They were picked up by Uncle Ma.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.280
It's not enough.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.240
He said there were only two cans.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.800
Are there really only two cans?

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.000
Even a mule wouldn't be able to resist

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.390
upon seeing meth.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.480
This old bastard

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.840
never tells the truth.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.030
He's always lying.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.210
After I finish eating,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.200
I'll get the goods back from him.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.590
Why are you two sitting so far apart?

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.680
Come and sit closer.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.440
There's plenty of room here.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.950
Come on, move over here.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.590
You almost sat on my lap.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.680
You could sit on my lap if you want.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.200
Come on.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.440
Let's drink up.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.160
No sipping allowed.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.550
Finish it all.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.510
Come on, boss.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.790
I'll sing you a song.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.960
Happiness is all that matters.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.780
This song...

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.880
Sir, you should have told us earlier
you were bringing friends.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.480
Let's have a drink together.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.080
Go.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.260
We're out for some fun.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.360
Is your injury better?

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.510
Is it healed?

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.750
That hostess sold me out!

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.120
How much do you have left?

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.150
About 50 kilos,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.650
more or less.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.630
Is that all you have?

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.810
Who are you trying to fool?

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:15.410
It's true.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.270
Tell the truth.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.050
Just about 50 kilos.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.070
Is it more or less?

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.200
I didn't weigh them,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.060
so it can't be that precise.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.240
Be more precise.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.550
I swear.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.400
It's 50 kilos.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.460
It was hard enough getting that much.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.050
That girl just now wasn't

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.030
as heavy as 50 kilos.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.290
I'm telling the truth.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.390
Give me the goods.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.660
I'll compensate you.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.520
How much compensation?

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.870
How much do you want?

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.160
2 million.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.720
I'm not quite catching
what you're saying.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.250
How much?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.790
2 million.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.770
Let me tell you something.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.160
These goods were ours to begin with.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.110
We're taking them back now.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.000
I'm offering to pay you.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.330
You should be grateful.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.070
It wasn't easy for us

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.370
to get those goods.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720
I risked my life.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720
I even went to jail.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.310
And...

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.270
I've suffered a lot.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.070
Finders keepers.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.070
Say that again!

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.600
Haipeng.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.430
Uncle Ma.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.540
After what happened at the beach,

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.670
the police have tightened security.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.430
How do you plan to move these goods?

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.140
This shipment in your hands

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.590
is a ticking time bomb.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.780
Both gangs and police will be after you.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.680
So, I'm the only one

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.600
who can take this off your hands.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.020
How much?

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.610
1 million.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.240
I have no choice.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.410
I have two kids.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.120
I need to send them abroad.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.940
1 million is

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.790
for three people's future.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.930
1 million might not even be enough.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.750
You're a good father.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.790
What about me?

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.070
Okay.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.310
He said okay.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.150
Hello, Chief Fang.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.350
Yes, Liu Bingqiang
is undergoing rescue procedures.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.030
Kui,

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.110
I know you're eager to solve the case.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.570
Could you be more careful?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.440
If something happened to you too,

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.230
the consequences would be serious.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.800
Have you thought about that?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.480
Yes, yes.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.840
I used a bit too much force.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.969
Well, Chief Fang,

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.960
I'll take responsibility.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.110
If we lose Liu Bingqiang as a lead,

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.909
I'll take full responsibility.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.360
About Liu Bingqiang,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.730
report to me immediately
if anything changes.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.150
Okay, understood.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.590
Master.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:30.800
What's happening?

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.280
Nothing serious.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.190
Doctor.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.360
The patient's condition has stabilized.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.110
He is no longer in critical danger.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.350
Okay, thank you.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.030
Captain Luo said

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.760
Liu Bingqiang's condition is stable.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.190
Wen has been taken away too.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.280
I've completed my mission,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.280
and can leave now.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.150
You must be really happy

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.550
to be leaving this place.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.550
Am I?

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.020
Look at that grin on your face.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.230
You can tell that, huh?

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.190
Of course.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.440
If there's nothing else,
I'll be on my way.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.220
Wait.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.710
Don't you like fried hairtail?

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.280
I fried some for you.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.360
No, thanks. Keep it for yourself.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.180
I'm off...

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.100
Thank you, Uncle Yang.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.480
You changed the way how you address me?

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.510
You called me dad these past few days,

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.760
now it's back to Uncle Yang.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.580
We have completed our mission,

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.070
so I should call you "Uncle" again.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.590
Fine,

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.050
"Uncle Yang" sounds good.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.400
Remember,

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.960
be sure to be careful.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:50.800
I'm off.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.400
Go on then.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.070
-I really must be off now.
-Go ahead.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.400
Too talkative. Just go.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.550
Bye.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.100
All the goods are here.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.400
The market isn't good.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.360
I'll sell them off cheap.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480
They're all here.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.870
[June 14, 2006]

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:45.670
Any problems?

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.270
No problem.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.540
You old guy!

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.810
All you care about is money.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.840
Spend it wisely.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.050
I will.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.330
How much money is in this card?

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.070
I'll give you the remaining 500,000

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:08.840
in a few days.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.370
You're Mou Haidong's son.
I trust you.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.700
No problem.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.220
You'll need a boat

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.360
to leave Nanzhou, right?

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.270
How did you know?

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.120
Leave it to me.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.790
Thanks for your help.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.760
Just call me if you have any news.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.280
I'll treat you to karaoke sometime.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.810
I'm really good at singing.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.550
Good my ass!

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.440
Life is vast like the sea. Just be happy.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.370
The young girls are crazy about me.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.820
Don't mess around.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:43.980
Be careful.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.910
I'm home, Mom.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.520
You're home!

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.160
Look what delicious food I brought you.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.540
Fried hairtail!

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.480
My colleague made it.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.880
Try some. It tastes wonderful.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.230
Where have you been these past few days?

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.710
You didn't even call.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.840
It's my job.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.030
It's confidential stuff.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.590
Alright,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.710
confidential, I understand.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.080
I know your rules.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.850
There's fried hairtail?

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.800
Looks like you've been
treating yourself well.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.480
Come on, sit here.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.320
Let's dig in.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.720
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.480
Look at those dark circles.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.070
You haven't been
sleeping well lately, have you?

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.190
I'm fine.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.520
Come on, have your meal.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:32.700
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.180
I made you worry.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.360
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your mom.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.360
You worked so hard on your missions.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.800
There's one more dish in the kitchen.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.710
Don't wait for me, just start.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.440
No need, Mom.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.960
-Don't worry. It’s almost done.
-I just came back to change clothes.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.710
I need to leave again.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:44.880
You don't need to cook anymore.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.260
It'll be ready soon.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.240
I didn't disappoint you this time, did I,

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:11.840
Dad?

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.510
This shipment is only 50 kilos.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.170
How can we make this deal work?

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.910
We'd better do business with Master Du.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.630
With just this small amount,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.290
can we get your brother
and my sister back?

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.770
Will that old man agree?

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.290
If he doesn't agree, we'll make him agree.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.150
Fine.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.960
Where do you get all this confidence from?

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.060
The 500,000 for Mule,

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:50.600
I borrowed it from loan sharks.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.290
When the deal is done,
I'll pay you back twenty times.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.320
How much?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.800
Twenty times.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.710
That's 10 million!

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.110
They got the goods ready so quickly?

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.610
Are you kidding me?

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.290
He wants to talk to you.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.440
Thank you.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.540
Master Du.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.320
So you're the cook?

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.280
Yes.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.400
How can I believe

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.460
that you prepared 200 kilos of goods
so quickly?

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.490
It's normal for you
to have doubts, Master Du.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.640
Let me put it this way.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.660
I'll have my brother

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.560
deliver 20 kilos to another location.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.220
After you verify them,

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.240
I'll personally bring the rest.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.360
Then we can talk.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.190
However,

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.920
I beg you to release that lady first.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.190
Does she mean something to you?

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.960
Yes.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.820
She's my woman.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.370
Alright.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.390
But those 20 kilos goods,

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.670
how will your brother bring them in?

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.130
By the water route.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400
Do you have a boat?

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.230
My boat probably can't enter Xin Ji.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.210
I might need to trouble you, Master Du,

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.510
to meet us at sea.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.360
Fine.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.600
I'll wait for your message.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.540
Thank you for saving my sister first.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.220
Xiaomin means nothing

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.440
to them.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.710
But as for Mou Lang...

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:04.790
they won't let him go easily.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.590
Don't worry.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.800
I'll handle the boat situation.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.330
I have friends who can help.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.760
You just said

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.630
you needed someone to transport the goods.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.110
Were you thinking of me?
