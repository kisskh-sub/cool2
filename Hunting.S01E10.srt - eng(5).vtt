[Episode 10]

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.400
You just said

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.060
you need someone to transport goods.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.870
Do you want me to go?

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.090
Of course not you.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.940
I have someone in mind.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.340
Grandpa.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.150
How's it going?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.169
Has Mou Lang talked yet?

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.740
Not yet.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.480
But I have a good relationship with him.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.960
If that cook gets the goods,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.940
he'll definitely use them

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.480
to trade for his brother.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.079
You don't have much time.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.010
You need to make Mou Lang talk soon.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.750
No problem, Grandpa.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.190
But you need to know your limits

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.310
in everything you do.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.370
I know, Grandpa.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.970
It's been so long.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.270
Why don't you trust me?

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.730
Are you not satisfied

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.329
with my performance lately?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.750
If

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.770
you want to take over Xin Sheng He,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.190
you haven't been tested enough yet.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.160
No problem.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.930

Tell him my surname is Mou.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.530
OK, we'll confirm by phone.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250
Mr. Huang, someone is here to see you.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.630
Uncle Huang.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.720
You've been through a lot.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.630
How is it?

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.720
Is it OK?

Please arrange for me

to see him one more time.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.920
According to the law,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.980
before execution,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.990
family members can have one last visit.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.860
I'll help you apply for it.

to find ways to save you.

He wants to get dad's account, doesn't he?

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.630
Your father

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.790
believed he could protect you.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.310
He could protect me?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.240
My father was confused.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.720
Without you,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.550
he can't access the account.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.680
Also,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.159
he's desperate to have his name written

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.520
in the family genealogy

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.420
to gain recognition from the family.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.780
So he won't harm his own sibling.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.680
Uncle Huang,

What about this?

Then I'll figure out

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.270
how to get you back as soon as possible.

I found a way out for you.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.440
What kind of way?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.730
A fishing boat.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.230
They've moved goods for me before.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.490
They're trustworthy.

Duozai helped me before.

Think of this as me returning the favor.

When there’s no money,

everyone values loyalty and friendship.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.520
But you can stick to the principles,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.600
even when money is involved.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.800

Before you leave,

I'll definitely give it to you.

Uncle,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.480
you're amazing.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.270
Where did you find the fishing boat?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.580
Do you know

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.950
what "having great powers" means?

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.510
Just look at me and you'll understand.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.360
That's what it means to have great powers.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.390
After we leave the country,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.450
you won't have to be worried anymore.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.700
From now on,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.330
you're my godfather.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.170
OK.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.550
I accept you.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.510
Godson,

to surviving in this world.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.950
Never be the first to stick your neck out.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.750
Being just good enough is the best.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.000
Remember that. It's important.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.870
OK.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.240
What's wrong?

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.240
Didn't you always want to go abroad?

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.830
I did, but I never thought

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.870
I'd leave as a fugitive.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.340
Everyone

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.510

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.600
It's my fault.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.830
Your dad is useless.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.740
I couldn't give you a decent life.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.169
Good that you realize it.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.610
But this time is different.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.000
Don't worry.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.360
When we go abroad this time,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.220
I'm completely awakened.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.150
When we are abroad,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.690
I absolutely won't cause you any trouble,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.280
OK?

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.830
We'll live a good life.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.390
Come on, eat a chicken foot

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.000
so you can grab more money.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.550
We couldn't live well here,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.040
how can we live well after going abroad?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.470
You shouldn't put it that way.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.600
This is our rebirth from the ashes,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.120
right?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:08:59.870
I've made up my mind.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.030
We'll go to Southeast Asia first,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.480
where there are many Chinese people.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.140
And you two

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.690
find a proper job,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.270
OK?

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.640
I can be a taxi driver.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.450
Don't worry. I'm a good driver.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.320
You wanted to study, right?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.520
Dad will support you.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.280
You can go to school now, Duozai.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.930
I believe you.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.390
That's good.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.060
Then our family will be

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.960
happy

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.720
and harmonious.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.440
Cheers!

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.260
Come on!

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.360
To a happy life!

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.870
Our happy life starts now.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.350
Cheers!

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.270
Who's family with you?

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.440
You made him your godson,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.900
but I never agreed to that.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.240
You two can drink together.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.550
What are you saying, my god brother?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.510
That's ridiculous.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.910
Don't joke around. Come on.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.440
Exactly.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440
Eat this to grab some more money.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.320
He calls you godbrother now.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.430
Aren't we family?

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.570
I knew your father left something for you.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.370
Aren't we friends?

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.400
Friends shouldn't keep secrets

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.370
from each other.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.630
Do you consider me a friend?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.080
Of course.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.690
But I don't blame you.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.530
Hand over Mou Haidong's account.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.360
We won't give you any more trouble.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.120
My father gave it to me to save my life.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.910
Save your life?

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.110
Save your life?

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.990
Let's see how you save your life now.
