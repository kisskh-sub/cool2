00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600
I hope you really think this over

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.120
and see if you can give me a chance.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.760
I've never stopped loving you.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160
What is it?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Pong's taking me
to the temple fair tonight.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.320
Make sure he takes care of you.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.600
- If anything goes wrong,
- Hey!

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.400
he'll be the first one I blame.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.480
- What the fuck?
- Hey, hey.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.200
Hey!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.040
What is that?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.080
Thanks to all of you
for letting me have a fun time.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.440
You won't get away with this.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.200
They're all safe now.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.120
Only Pong is seriously wounded,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.400
but his life isn't in danger.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240
Thanks a lot.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.000
Go on and keep patrolling.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.320
Yes, Master.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.360
I knew you liked this song,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.880
so I brought you a new tape.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.920
I hope to be the person in this song

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.800
who soothes you when you're sad

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.600
and stands by you when you're happy.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.400
Please give me a chance.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.040
Thank you, Uncle.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.840
Master!

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.150
Master, please help Pong.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.010
I already know.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.760
Take him upstairs.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.680
Come on. Let's go.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.440
Hurry.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.000
You came to me for help

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.710
and are staying under my roof.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.640
That makes you mine now.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.640
I've helped you many times,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.200
not for someone to hurt you like this.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.080
Master...

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.680
♫Search your heart and tell me who,♫

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.300
♫Who can love you more than I do?♫

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.580
I'm sorry.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.400
I...

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:36.970
I can't.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.240
♫Tell me what's true♫

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.120
♫Your eyes speak clearly,
you're just sorry♫

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:53.920
♫Love who you will, no need to worry♫

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.360
♫Even if it hurts, my heart won't flee♫

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.280
♫For it's you,
I can bear the pain endlessly♫

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.200
I...

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.040
I understand.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.659
Khem...

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.200
It's okay, Master.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120
Let's just...

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.840
forget what happened.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.640
[Phra Nakhon, 1947]

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.080
Uh...

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.240
It's the letter from the diplomat.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.480
Now that the war is over,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.240
she wanted to help me,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.480
so she wrote a letter
to help me pursue my studies in the U.S.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.280
So you're leaving me, too.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040
What about me?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.640
You're coming with me.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.280
Let's leave this life here

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.640
and be together over there.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.960
We'll be free,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.480
and no one will judge us
the way they do here.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.600
Come with me.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.040
I will.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.120
From now on,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.160
let's share
the rest of our lives together.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.800
Da!

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.520
- We're not...
- "We're not at home."

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.320
It's okay, Jin.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.520
We're leaving this place soon.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.280
Oh...

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.200
Grandma!

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.760
- Good morning, Grandma.
- Good morning.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.600
Hi.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.840
Good morning.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440
Whoa,

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.560
you're all here?

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.120
Why would you all come?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.840
We're here to visit you.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.160
I heard from Uncle Chai
that you've been feeling unwell

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.520
and had to see a doctor.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.080
I'm already in my last days,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.200
and the doctor's telling me
to cut down on sugar.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.640
Just listen to the doctor.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.640
You're not a spring chicken anymore.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.400
What?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.120
I am listening to the doctor.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.240
I wouldn't share this with the kids
if I weren't.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.320
Eat up, kids.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.320
It's yummy.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.880
I made it myself.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.170
Why are you so hungry, Jet?

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.680
Don't know

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.880
Guess I went a bit overboard last night.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.040
Do they have this in Bangkok, Khem?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.080
Not freshly steamed ones.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.720
This is amazing.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.160
Do you want my recipe?

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.720
So that you can make this for...

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.760
Master.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.120
My recipe is amazing.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.520
He likes my desserts.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.760
And his favorite dessert
when he was young...

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.880
Hey, Grandma.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.360
Take it easy.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.400
You're running out of breath.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.800
Some water, Grandma.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.839
I'm better now.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640
Grandma,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.080
you're still taking
Pra-taba turmeric, right?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.480
From what I read,
it contains high levels of mercury.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.400
How about taking a break
from it for now?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.000
It might be causing your sickness.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.080
I'm only taking a bit,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.440
so I don't think it's the cause.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.440
I appreciate your worry, though.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.680
Just listen to Khem, Grandma.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320
I'm worried about you.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.840
Why would you be?

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.840
Don't waste your time
on someone this old.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.400
What do you mean?

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.880
You're the only one I have, Grandma.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.200
Live a long life and stay with me.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.560
I'm old now,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.400
and I don't know
how many years I have left.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.560
I've lived more than enough.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.920
You, Master,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.000
should take care of yourself

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.400
and find someone to look after you.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.960
That's nonsense, Grandma.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.120
It is not.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.840
You're just a shaman, not a monk.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.940
Even Grand Master Sek

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.200
had a family.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.280
If you have a lover,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.920
you're not doing anything wrong.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280
All done.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.640
We've done all the dishes

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.640
and put the water in the fridge.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.480
We're taking our leave, Grandma.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.180
Good luck.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.480
Good luck. May you be blessed.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400
Master,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.920
if you lose him,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.320
you'll regret it.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.720
Wait up, Jet.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.760
Khem!

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.640
Khem...

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.000
What happened last night...

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160
Well...

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.600
I...

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800
Oh, Prim?

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280
Hello.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620
Hi, guys.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.880
Master,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.800
Prim's here.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.520
There you go.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.360
Messed around and found out, huh?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.280
Hey, easy on me.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.600
It's still sore.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.520
Don't practice too hard for now.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.600
Postpone the next match, too.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.600
Thank you for saving me.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.600
Come on.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.840
Let's go home.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.640
I have something
to talk to Master about.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.120
Jet,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.880
go make Pong a pennywort drink.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.900
I can make him one.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.880
Jet, Charn, you can go tidy up the room.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.320
Oh...

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.960
Right. Okay.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.400
Do you wanna come with me, Pong?

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.440
Sure.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.670
You should change the sheet, too.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.560
I was sweating a lot last night.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.560
Sorry.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.360
Alright.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.920
We should hurry

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.640
'cause we need to change our sheet, too.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.360
Come on, go.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:36.040
Hurry.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.180
Go now.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.560
You're still into
vintage stuff, aren't you?

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.240
Are you ready
to give me an answer, Paran?

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.520
Please call me Master like you used to,

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.320
Prim.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120
I get it.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.980
Maybe I'm not enough for you.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.160
It's not like that.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.600
You're perfect, Prim.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.680
It's my fault.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.920
My feelings are for someone else now.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.440
I'm sorry...

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.560
I didn't tell you sooner,

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.440
but I needed some time, too.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.000
I never meant to lie to you

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.160
or to give you false hope.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.800
You must be really mad at me

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.600
- that I kept you waiting.
- I am.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.960
How could I, actually?

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.960
But it's true that I'm disappointed.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.960
It's not funny, Prim.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.400
I'm sorry.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.520
I was probably shocked

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.240
to hear your honest answer

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.080
that you have feelings for someone.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.800
I just didn't know how to react.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.200
It's too old.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.040
I don't know if it still works.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.280
♫Search your heart and tell me who♫

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.640
I wonder...

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.760
who stole your heart.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.080
Who is it?

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:20.280
♫Why keep your secrets?
Give me a clue♫

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.720
♫We're not strangers,
tell me what's true♫

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.840
♫Your eyes speak clearly,
you're just sorry♫

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.880
♫Love who you will, no need to worry♫

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:47.360
♫Even if it hurts, my heart won't flee♫

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.120
♫For it's you,
I can bear the pain endlessly♫

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.800
♫Please, please save your tears♫

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.480
♫If your love's for him,
just erase me here♫

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.960
♫Don't let guilt make you fear♫

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.000
Khem,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.400
with that much pressure,

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.600
it must've turned into powder.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400
I'm sorry.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.840
Thank you

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.560
for saving me last night.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.000
Anyway,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.640
you can show me more places.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.830
Painting suits you way better

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.280
than acting.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920
Sorry?

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.000
Well,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.200
you're bad at acting.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.000
I can tell you're not into me.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.720
I don't think...

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.360
you even meant to give me a chance.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.040
You...

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.420
already love someone, don't you?

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.160
And you brought me here...

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.480
not to give them space

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.480
but to make him jealous, right?

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.440
So,

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.520
you can tell?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.360
I bet...

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.880
everyone could, except you.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.920
Don't do this.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.200
You could end up hurt.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.680
Sometimes...

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.840
love makes us do this kind of stuff.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.220
I don't know how things are going
between you and him.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.520
But I think...

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.200
it's better to be honest with yourself.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.720
Thanks, Pong.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.520
But...

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.960
actually,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.560
I'm gonna have to...

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.800
go through heartbreak, too.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.600
♫Search your heart and tell me who♫

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440
Let this heal you.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.840
Come on, Pong.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.680
Go ahead and drink it.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.000
It heals physical pain,
not a broken heart.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.360
Just drink it.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.400
We both need to heal.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.120
♫Your eyes speak clearly,
you're just sorry♫

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.480
Gosh...

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.400
It's more bitter than I expected.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.040
Ew.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.239
Try this.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.880
Does that help?

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.440
I think so.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.480
Whoa...

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.840
That's even worse.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.760
It's too bad.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.080
Wanna drink it?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.240
There, there. Don't cry.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.720
Stop that.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080
I'm perfectly fine.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.660
- Really? Are you?
- Yeah.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.320
Wanna comfort me instead?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.520
There, there.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.320
There, there.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160
Khem...

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:42.880
Wait...

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.480
Shit!

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.240
Did anyone see it?

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320
My bad.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.920
I'll be gentler next time.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.920
Was that alright?

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.720
Hey!

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.560
Was what alright?

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.000
No more!

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.240
There won't be a next time.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.280
I thought you liked it.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.690
Or...

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.040
- did I do anything wrong last night?
- Stop.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.640
You were great.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.360
Amazing, actually, but...

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.760
Can we talk about this later?

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040
It's true.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.520
I'm not hot enough.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.800
You tried with me,

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.680
yet I'm still just a friend.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.280
- It's not like that!
- What is it, then?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.080
Well...

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:08.960
I mean...

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.120
Like...

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.680
You're not a friend,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.180
but...

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.520
something more than that.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.440
Just a bit more.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.680
But...

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.210
let's be friends for now,

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.400
alright?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.280
Let's take it slow.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.640
- You didn't take it slow last night.
- Stop it, Charn.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.280
We're not by ourselves.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.640
We need to spend this night with Khem.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.040
Let's just talk about this later.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.800
He's coming.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760
Master?

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.380
Have you tried it before?

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.680
It's green chiretta.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.480
Master,

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.680
how do you know

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.920
that I'm unwell?

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.960
Well, your cough was so loud.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.480
I knew you wouldn't stand it.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.280
Take small sips.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.600
It's hot.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.840
It's so bitter.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.360
I hope it really helps.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.960
Can we talk
about what happened last night?

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.280
I'm sorry I suddenly approached you

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.960
and made you feel uncomfortable.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.200
But I want you to know that I did it...

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.440
because I have feelings for you, Khem.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.160
You know it, don't you?

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.960
So...

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.280
did you stop

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.720
because Prim came to mind?

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.800
Not Prim,

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.600
but my mom.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.520
It was her favorite song.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.040
She was taken

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.540
by someone else's karmic enemy,

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.160
like a curse that clung to you.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.140
She came to my mind,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.240
and I realized

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.040
I can't bear
to lose anyone I love ever again.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.720
And now I realize

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.560
I just need this moment,

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.600
just for a little while,

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.760
to listen to my heart

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.320
and tell you how I feel.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.520
Master...

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.880
You feel the same way, don't you, Khem?

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.760
♫Please, let my prayer start,♫

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.800
♫May we never ever need to part♫

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.160
♫Please, I beg with all my heart,♫

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.600
♫May you never leave, never depart♫

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.880
♫Should any magic bind you to my side,♫

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:51.320
♫I'll cast the spell to keep you mine♫

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.440
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:00.960
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.600
Uh...

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.480
Aren't my lips bitter?

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.400
I just had the green chiretta.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.800
No.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.320
They're sweet.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.800
♫Should any magic bind you to my side,♫

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:40.240

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.640
♫Only to keep you near

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.080
♫Should heaven be kind,♫

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.000
♫May it never take away my light♫

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.720
♫'Cause you keep me alive♫

♫Please be in my life♫

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.200
Why can't you let anyone know?

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.080
Khem and you being in love

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120
isn't wrong, is it?

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.480
I know,

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.080
but it's not the right time.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.560
Both Khem and I agree on this.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.840
But Jet and Charn aren't anyone, Master.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.840
If they found out,
they'd definitely be over the moon.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.360
Both of them need to keep training

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.760
to be able to protect Khem.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.640
I don't want them
getting distracted by anything else.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.540
It could lead to mistakes.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.800
Still, Master,

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.880
Khem can't hide what he's feeling.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.520
Can we really keep this
from Jet and Charn?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.400
Please.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.600
Please, Master.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.600
- Master...
- Please.

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.880
Please, Master.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.040
Please.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.600
I knew

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.040
you couldn't resist.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.520
You're making him
a cushion, too, after all.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.440
That's good.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.080
Though he doesn't like you,

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.240
it doesn't mean you're just strangers.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.440
Yeah,

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280
you're right.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.520
Guys,

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.360
Pong told me

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.120
Master and Prim have agreed
to be just friends.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.840
What? Aren't you guys surprised?

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:14.960
Well,

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.880
it's none of my business, right?

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.400
So...

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.240
did he also tell you

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.440
the reason?

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.600
He didn't.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.780
Could it be that

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.440
he's into someone else?

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.440
What do you mean?

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.880
I don't think so.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.920
Someone who is virtuous
wouldn't care about love stuff.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.760
It's nice

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.400
that he made it clear to Prim
that they can only be friends.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.160
They've known each other for so long,

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.020
yet he firmly denied her.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.240
I think that'll help you move on, right?

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.320
Yeah.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.040
That's right.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.320
Are you sick, Khem?

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.240
The way you're talking sounds weird.

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.400
What's wrong?

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.360
You went to get lozenges last night,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.200
and it took forever.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.240
Lozenges?

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.440
Oh...

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.160
I couldn't find any,

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.960
so I didn't take them.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.880
So...

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.360
Uh...

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.120
I'll...

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.000
go get some...

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.240
lozenges.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.240
I'm getting eye pain.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.060
I'll continue my meditation,

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.080
hoping it might help me
see things more clearly.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.040
My face's up here.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.960
I'm sorry.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.160
Is this one mine?

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:31.920
Yes.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.960
I made this especially for you.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.600
Thanks.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.800
I'll put on my clothes.

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.240
Wait, Master...

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:19.800
Uh...

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.460
What do your tattoos mean?

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.400
My grandfather
once recalled my past life,

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.880
and it seems

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.900
I was somehow linked to a Naga.

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.700
He had me get it tattooed for good luck.

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600
Does that mean...

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.520
you were a Naga in your past life?

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.800
Maybe not.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.280
He only said there was a link.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.160
I might have been
just a servant of a Naga.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.420
At that time,

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.200
we might have met

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.680
and stayed together,

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.660
just like Pawat and Khemmika,

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.240
and like you and me now.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.800
Do you think
others have fates like ours?

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.400
Not necessarily.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.680
But every action we take

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.800
leaves its mark on someone else,

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.000
whether we realize it or not.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.200
Like Ramphueng.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.040
She's haunting me through every life,

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040
and I don't even know
what I did to deserve it.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
You're right.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.320
Maybe it's because of her

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.520
that our paths crossed again.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.240
Not just mine and yours.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.100
What do you mean?

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.880
In fact, both Jet and Charn

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.200
have been bound to you
since your previous life.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.060
Perhaps it's time for us
to recall our past lives.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.720
Ever since I began my training,

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.160
I've been dreaming of Chayada.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.680
But I just realized
Master had already known.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
But...

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.970
how much do you know?

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.800
I know that both of you

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.240
were Khemmika's best friends.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320
Why?

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.480
Anything else I need to know?

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.200
Oh,

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.920
nothing, Master.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.780
I was just curious.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.720
Focus your mind

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.960
and recall the feeling you had
when you faced Ramphueng.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.920
I'm Khem, Khemmika.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.360
You guys

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.120
really need to
come hang out with me often.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.800
Look, now that Khem has her own place...

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.440
Just like when we were in school!

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.240
She will be too annoyed
to ever feel lonely.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.160
Khem!

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.000
- Wake up and talk to me!
- Calm down, Jin.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.120
Is that Jintana?

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.880
I can only hear Da talk.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
Me, too.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.920
I can only hear Khemmika.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.760
If we tell her,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.690
will it make her feel even lonelier?

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.760
Wait,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.440
I think I can hear a baby crying.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.000
I mean...

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.560
an infant.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.040
Focus,

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.840
and let that cry guide you.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Mom?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.920
Shit,

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.040
I think I'm hearing it, too.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
So am I.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.600
Focus your mind

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.440
and fix it on Khem.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.240
What happened, Master?

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640
I saw it.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.080
It's someone my grandfather knew.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.920
Does Monk Kasem

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.880
have something to do with this boy?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.520
I'm not so sure myself.

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:38.840
That's why I want to look into it.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.680
Do you happen to know where he is?

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.560
They say

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.560
he became a revered monk
down in the South.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.920
I'll try to reach out to his disciples.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.920
It's been over a decade
since he withdrew from worldly life,

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.880
so I can't promise I'll find him.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Very well, Grandma.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.600
If you can reach him,

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.640
please tell him

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.480
we need his help with Ramphueng.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.400
If he has something to do with this,

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.800
he'll understand.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120
Sure.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.960
Leave it to me.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.640
Don't know what's wrong with me today.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.280
I feel more exhausted than usual.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120
I'm struggling to breathe.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.400
Grandma,

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.080
perhaps you should stay with Uncle Chai.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.800
If you're all by yourself,

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.400
I'll be worried.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.760
I'm not going anywhere.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.440
I'm staying here.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.400
Chai and everyone visit me often enough.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.160
Look,

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.640
he's here.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:43.920
Speak of the devil.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.440
Hey...

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.840
Easy, Grandma.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.600
I feel better now.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.640
I'm alright.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:13.840
Okay.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.680
I was just excited.

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.240
Master,

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.680
can we pull over?

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.680
During the ritual last night,
my mom came to my mind.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.600
So I thought I'd make her chili paste

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.120
and dedicate it to her.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080
Master,

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.080
wanna help me get this?

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.200
If you're worried about Grandma Si,

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.040
why not let her stay with us?

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560
My power may be white magic,

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.640
but I do have black magic stuff
in my house.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440
An invocation performer like her

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.600
might lose her power
if she comes too close.

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.140
It seems like...

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.520
you love her so much.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:28.720
She nurtured me together
with my grandfather.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.840
Every vital force in this village

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.400
is under her care.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.840
I really wish she could have a break.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.480
But everyone's also taking care of her.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.760
You don't have to worry.

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.520
Please let me...

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.920
Please don't worry, Master.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.120
Peem.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.400
Yes?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.880
From now on,

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.580
when we're by ourselves,

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.880
call me Peem.

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.880
Okay, Peem.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.360
Well,

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.320
should we get it now?

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.720
Come on.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.200
How much do you want?

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.920
Some more, please.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.520
Master was right.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.600
He knows Ramphueng.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.880
He'll catch the train early tomorrow
to come to us.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.160
Thank you, Grandma.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.160
No worries.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Good luck, guys.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.400
Get yourself ready, too.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.960
He's also your old friend.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.520
Let me know if you need anything.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.440
Okay.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.160
If I need your help,

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.600
I'll let you know.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.840
Will I get to see you, Kasem?

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:59.320
Will I be able
to take a deep breath until then?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.680
You two, go wait for Monk Kasem.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.760
With Khem's birthday approaching,

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.000
Ramphueng's power will grow stronger.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.760
He might be able to help us.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.040
How's everything?

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.320
The train had some trouble.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.720
They're waiting to change trains
in Buri Ram

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.360
and will arrive here by morning.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.800
Then we've come all this way
for nothing.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.200
I don't get it.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.360
Why are both Monk Kasem and Master

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800
so against mobile phones?

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.840
They're virtuous. That's why.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.720
What should we do?

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.040
Should we leave?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.160
So Charn and I
[Jet]

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.800
are gonna stay at a hotel.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.600
Can you stay alone tonight?

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.680
Sure.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.780
Master's with me. I'll be okay.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.680
Master...

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.040
I mean,

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:08.630
Peem,

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.600
you can come in.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.400
Okay.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040
Sure.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.240
Take care of yourself, okay?

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.600
Don't worry about me.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.080
Uh...

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.640
Hurry back tomorrow, alright?

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.640
Bye-bye.

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:49.400
You're teasing me.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.120
I'm not.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.400
I was just worried.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.480
So you're sleeping alone tonight?

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.280
No one's around.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.600
What if Ramphueng comes and harms you?

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.280
Why?

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.380
You wanna be with me instead?

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.240
No.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.480
If you can be alone, then that's fine.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.320
Peem,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.240
won't you feel tired?

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:18.840
It's nothing.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.720
This isn't the first time I've stayed up
watching over you.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200
You're right.

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.220
You've always helped me,

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.440
even though you were cold.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040
Thank you.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.500
And...

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.360
I'm sorry for always giving you trouble.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.390
You're not.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.180
I'm always willing to help you.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.000
How about lying down on the bed
and getting comfy?

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.160

[Dharma]

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.240
I thought
you wanted to sleep by yourself.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.240
It's just that...

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.840
when I realize
how little time I have left,

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:06.680
I'm afraid that

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.760
if I don't follow my heart now,

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:12.120
I might not get another chance.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.010
So...

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:39.480
I don't know what I'm currently feeling.

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.480
Rak, sometimes,
it's nothing complicated.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.920
Don't make it seem that way.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.960
Just say whatever you're feeling.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.160
Sometimes, things you're worrying about
in your mind

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.120
might not be like what you thought.

I'm the one supporting you.

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:16.300
You just keep staring.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.080
What's your problem, huh?

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.560
Nothing. I'm just a friend.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.720
There you go again.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.120
I already told you

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.560
you're more than that.

What do you mean, then?

A friend is a friend.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.400
What's more than a friend?

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.000
I don't know, man.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.880
I don't even know

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.240
if these feelings are mine or Jintana's.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.440
My dad just gave me a matching name

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.040
like it was meant to be.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.040
We've loved each other
since our past lives.

01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.160
So why complicate things?

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.200
Wait,

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.040
you don't believe in past lives, do you?

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.840
I do now.

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.660
I really feel connected to you, Jet.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.440
And I even lost my virginity to you.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.560
Don't make it sound like
you're the victim.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.280
I also lost mine to you.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.120
Shit...

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.160
Saying it aloud makes me flustered.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520
You're flustered because of me?

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.000
Yeah.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.280
Well,

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.040
I've never done it with anyone before.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.920
So...

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.640
I'm your first?

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680
Obviously.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:30.880
So...

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.520
let me be confused for now.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.000
I'm...

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.000
not ready to make any decisions.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560
Gosh, what are you doing?

You're just so cute, Jet.

It's so pretty.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:27.560
Grandma Si,

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720
it's pretty, isn't it?

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:10.600
Are you still taking Pra-taba?

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.560
I trust you,

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.680
hoping it helps.

01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:01.320
- Master!
- Master!

01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.160
Grandma,

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.000
let's head back to the shore.

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.120
It's getting hot.

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.680
You might get sick.

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.360
I might get sick?

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:48.240
But you guys...

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.480
will die.

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:06.360
You won't make it out alive this time.

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:25.840
- Master!
- Master!

01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.360
Go save Khem.

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:28.200
Look.

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:29.120
See it.

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.960
See what I had to go through.

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:32.360
Where is Grandma Si?

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.440
Please forgive me.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:40.990
Why should fortune smile upon you?

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:44.200
I have faithfully fulfilled my duties
as a wife for years,

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.240
yet you, a mere servant,

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:47.480
dare to take everything from me.

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.200
Ma'am!

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.360
They're lying, my lord.

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400
They're framing me.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.200
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:01.960
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:08.080
♫Though no spell works,
I'll pour my soul, my life,♫

01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.480
♫Only to keep you near
and hold you tight♫

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.880
♫Should heaven be kind,♫

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:18.840
♫May it never take away my light♫

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.520
♫'Cause you keep me alive♫

01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:26.560
♫Please be in my life♫

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:48.040
♫Please be in my life♫
