Yu Yiming?

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:09.936
I'll try the eyeshadow.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:13.357
Gone?

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:15.876
I'm right here.

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:17.396
What do you want?

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:19.237
I'll try the eyeshadow.

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:21.237
Go ahead.

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:26.757
This color looks nice.

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:28.556
Could you get me a lipstick?

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:29.357
Another color.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:30.917
I used No.103 yesterday.

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:31.957
Get me No.105 today.

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:41.116
It looks good.

00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:41.996
I'm leaving. Bye.

00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:43.996
Wait. It does look good.

00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:45.957
Why don't you buy one of the things

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:46.957
you just tried?

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:49.197
Why? I use the testers every time.

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:51.357
It's been a week, Miss.

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:53.797
Whether it's windy or pouring rain,

00:02:53.957 --> 00:02:55.556
you'd show up at 5 PM sharp

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:56.957
to freeload makeup.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.396
People might think you're here

00:02:58.436 --> 00:02:59.357
clocking in for work.

00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:00.676
An eyebrow pencil

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:02.077
only costs six yuan,

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:03.276
and you won't even buy one?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.077
Wait.

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:06.037
What do you mean "freeload makeup"?

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:07.317
I need to try them on

00:03:07.317 --> 00:03:08.477
before knowing what to buy.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:09.436
Besides,

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:11.276
you don't limit the makeup trials.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.064
(Trials up to 6 times a week.)

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:17.757
I never saw this before.

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:20.116
This rule was made specifically for you.

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:21.917
I just won't buy.

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:22.876
So what?

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:24.596
Save it.

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.116
This is consumer fraud!

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:27.676
I'll report you!

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:29.436
Focus on your job. Bye.

00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:47.757
Mom.

00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:49.757
I transferred the money.

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:50.517
Did you see it?

00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:54.517
Don't be frugal with it,

00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:57.197
calculating every egg for breakfast.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.317
It's not expensive!

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:00.996
I know you work hard for the money.

00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:02.716
Being alone in Jingzhou,

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:05.077
your health matters most.

00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:08.676
I told you I can earn enough.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:10.836
You don't know how much I make daily.

00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:11.797
I have everything.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.757
Okay, okay, okay.

00:04:13.037 --> 00:04:14.436
I know you're capable.

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:17.437
But take care of yourself.

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:32.396
Wh-What are those?

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:35.997
These are all the testers you tried.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.836
I brought you some new ones.

00:04:39.877 --> 00:04:41.877
Do your makeup at home from now on.

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:42.957
Don't come to the counter.

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:49.036
If you keep pestering me there,

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:50.356
I'll only be serving you.

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:51.276
How will I make money?

00:05:07.637 --> 00:05:08.557
It's almost expired.

00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:17.796
The warehouse is so hot.

00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:20.957
Qiao Lin, we're short-staffed now.

00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:22.036
Can you do dispatch?

00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:22.796
I can.

00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:24.432
These.

00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:25.584
Great.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:27.077
Let me help you.

00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:27.757
Thank you.

00:05:29.877 --> 00:05:30.596
Wait. Wait.

00:05:30.677 --> 00:05:31.197
Phone call.

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:31.957
Okay.

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:32.916
I can do it.

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:35.036
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:36.916
Mr. Zhang.

00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:39.637
An HQ meeting?

00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:41.437
Got it. Be right there.

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:46.197
What's wrong?

00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:48.396
Sorry. It's nothing.

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:48.916
I'm okay.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:50.396
I told you to wait.

00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:51.356
Be careful, will you?

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:51.997
Sorry.

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:52.396
My bad.

00:05:58.077 --> 00:05:59.437
Go to the hospital now.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.557
Just go. Leave it to me.

00:06:02.557 --> 00:06:03.437
Sorry, sir.

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:05.757
Th-Then I'll go first.

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:06.796
- Just go.
- I'm so sorry.

00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.036
Works a little and demands payment.

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:19.236
I got it scheduled.

00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:21.236
A top specialist appointment.

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:22.476
Your turn soon.

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:23.952
(No. 37 Qiao Lin)

00:06:24.757 --> 00:06:25.716
Thanks, Guan.

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:26.677
Sure thing.

00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:29.197
I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:30.077
We live together.

00:06:30.317 --> 00:06:31.356
We help each other out.

00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:33.836
If you ever need any help,

00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:35.036
you must tell me.

00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:39.317
Alright, I'm leaving.

00:06:39.356 --> 00:06:39.957
Back to stream.

00:06:39.997 --> 00:06:40.916
Leaving so soon?

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:42.276
I need money

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:43.757
to buy you bone broth.

00:06:44.877 --> 00:06:45.437
Love you!

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:46.077
Going now.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:46.637
Good luck.

00:06:46.757 --> 00:06:47.197
Bye.

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:49.317
Wait here.

00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:52.637
Now calling No. 37, Qiao Lin

00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:54.077
to Examination Room 4.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:55.156
Hold her.

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:57.836
God, will it hurt?

00:06:58.877 --> 00:06:59.356
It's okay.

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.396
Relax your muscles.

00:07:01.317 --> 00:07:02.637
You'll feel it, but hold on.

00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:09.156
Well?

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:12.156
That's it?

00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:14.637
Check it out.

00:07:15.197 --> 00:07:16.716
It seems... better now.

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:17.757
Help her up.

00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:19.197
Move it around.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:19.957
Don't force it.

00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:21.637
Okay, thank you.

00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:24.957
I feel better.

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:26.916
I've realigned it.

00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:29.117
No heavy lifting for three months,

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:31.077
and don't overuse it.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.036
Otherwise, you might re-dislocate.

00:07:34.957 --> 00:07:36.117
So... it heals this fast?

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:37.197
Will it hurt again?

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:39.036
If it hurts again later,

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:40.317
I'll come straight to you.

00:07:40.557 --> 00:07:42.317
I won't pay the registration fee.

00:07:45.396 --> 00:07:46.557
You really haven't changed.

00:07:50.197 --> 00:07:50.757
Qiao Lin.

00:07:56.557 --> 00:07:57.356
Yu Yiming?

00:07:57.546 --> 00:08:00.176
(Yu Yiming)

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:02.000
(City ranking: No. 1)

00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.557
Feels like we're growing apart.

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:07.197
Don't be sad.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.236
We're all repeating.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:09.156
We can hang out.

00:08:09.997 --> 00:08:10.317
Exactly.

00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.476
Think about it again.

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:12.517
Feel any better?

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.596
I actually feel worse.

00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:18.557
I'll give you drugs for the pain.

00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:20.796
You might not feel anything now,

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:22.557
but in 2-3 hours,

00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:23.476
it might hurt.

00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:25.396
Take meds if it's mild.

00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:27.517
If severe, come for an X-ray

00:08:27.836 --> 00:08:29.276
to check for soft tissue effusion.

00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:29.997
Okay.

00:08:30.637 --> 00:08:31.356
Thank you.

00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:35.157
Been here long?

00:08:35.917 --> 00:08:38.636
I arrived about two months ago.

00:08:39.077 --> 00:08:39.476
You live?

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:42.636
I share an apartment with two friends.

00:08:43.157 --> 00:08:43.557
Girls.

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:46.516
It's set back now.

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:47.917
But if any issues arise,

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:49.157
come see me immediately.

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:50.917
No registration fee.

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:54.836
Daily life will be inconvenient.

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:56.756
Contact your parents?

00:08:57.356 --> 00:08:58.596
They're back in our hometown.

00:08:59.557 --> 00:09:00.236
Qiao Yan?

00:09:04.157 --> 00:09:04.677
Qiao Yan.

00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:06.797
My letter.

00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:08.116
Did you read it?

00:09:10.037 --> 00:09:10.756
Take it back.

00:09:12.957 --> 00:09:13.476
Yu Yiming.

00:09:13.876 --> 00:09:15.317
I came today to tell you

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:17.957
I don't want to date.

00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:20.236
I just want to focus on studying.

00:09:20.557 --> 00:09:21.957
Other things aren't in my plans.

00:09:22.236 --> 00:09:23.397
I won't disturb your studies.

00:09:24.317 --> 00:09:25.756
I just wanted to say I like you.

00:09:25.797 --> 00:09:26.636
I don't like you.

00:09:41.077 --> 00:09:42.516
She goes by Xu Yan now.

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:44.277
Ever been in touch?

00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:45.677
Have you?

00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:48.596
No.

00:09:49.557 --> 00:09:51.116
She came here for college, right?

00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:52.077
Yes.

00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:54.557
But she's too busy with work now.

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:55.756
My injury is fine.

00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:56.437
I'm alright.

00:09:56.756 --> 00:09:58.037
Bone injuries are serious.

00:09:58.317 --> 00:09:59.636
Trust your doctor's advice.

00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:01.116
If it's awkward for you,

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:02.636
give me her number.

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:03.356
I'll call her.

00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:04.636
No, that's unnecessary.

00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:16.944
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

00:10:18.876 --> 00:10:20.596
I don't think she'll come.

00:10:20.636 --> 00:10:21.756
Her work keeps her occupied.

00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:24.197
You don't need to stay with me.

00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:25.037
I'm fine on my own.

00:10:25.836 --> 00:10:27.397
It's fine. I'm off duty anyway.

00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:30.197
Xu Yan.

00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:34.116
Yu Yiming?

00:10:34.716 --> 00:10:35.516
Long time no see.

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:42.236
What happened?

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:45.677
Nothing serious. Just a minor injury.

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:46.957
If you're busy,

00:10:46.957 --> 00:10:47.677
I'm fine.

00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:48.596
You can go back.

00:10:50.596 --> 00:10:51.716
It's been a long time.

00:10:52.077 --> 00:10:52.876
How have you been?

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:54.317
Working at?

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.317
After graduation,

00:10:58.437 --> 00:10:59.756
I stayed in Jingzhou.

00:11:00.797 --> 00:11:01.437
That's good.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:02.876
I work here.

00:11:03.876 --> 00:11:04.797
An orthopedic doctor.

00:11:08.116 --> 00:11:09.116
Thank you for today.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:10.197
Of course.

00:11:16.957 --> 00:11:17.596
You got married?

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:21.236
Yes, last month.

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:23.716
Though it's a bit late,

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:25.356
congratulations.

00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:29.037
Now that your sister's here,

00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:29.716
I'm relieved.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.077
Take your drugs.

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:33.677
If anything, let me know.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:39.636
Bye.

00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:01.516
Let's go.

00:12:03.437 --> 00:12:04.557
Okay, let's go.

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:08.437
Thanks for coming.

00:12:13.277 --> 00:12:14.636
My room is right across.

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:30.116
Found a place,

00:12:31.756 --> 00:12:32.876
got a job too.

00:12:34.636 --> 00:12:36.437
Seems you're really staying in Jingzhou.

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:37.996
Stop meddling in my affairs.

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:44.917
Those two are my roommates' rooms.

00:12:51.797 --> 00:12:52.356
Move out.

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:55.636
What nonsense are you saying?

00:12:55.797 --> 00:12:56.756
Your bedroom's small,

00:12:56.957 --> 00:12:58.157
with no private bathroom

00:12:58.756 --> 00:12:59.797
and barely any furniture.

00:13:01.917 --> 00:13:03.088
I'll find you a new place.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.516
Who asked you to do that?

00:13:06.197 --> 00:13:07.277
I'm not helping you.

00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:10.197
Since you're staying in Jingzhou,

00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:12.437
I don't need any trouble from you.

00:13:14.636 --> 00:13:15.596
If not for Yu Yiming,

00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:16.797
I wouldn't have called you.

00:13:17.157 --> 00:13:18.797
Even if I got hurt like today

00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.077
or die somewhere someday,

00:13:20.157 --> 00:13:22.356
I'd never blame you for it.

00:13:22.397 --> 00:13:22.876
Okay?

00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:27.356
What?

00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:34.516
The room right across.

00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:35.197
Empty it.

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:36.037
Thanks.

00:13:37.356 --> 00:13:38.116
Why are you inside?

00:13:38.356 --> 00:13:38.756
No, no.

00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:39.876
What now?

00:13:43.437 --> 00:13:44.476
I said I'm not moving!

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:45.957
Why dismantle my place?

00:13:47.197 --> 00:13:48.157
You have two options.

00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:49.077
First,

00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:51.317
have your parents
take you home to recover.

00:13:51.557 --> 00:13:52.756
Second, obey me.

00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:55.356
Who's the elder sister here?

00:13:55.516 --> 00:13:57.236
Don't think your success makes you king.

00:13:57.397 --> 00:13:58.476
Don't touch my things!

00:13:58.636 --> 00:13:59.476
Hands off my stuff!

00:14:00.236 --> 00:14:00.836
Keep this up,

00:14:00.876 --> 00:14:01.917
and I'll call the police.

00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.236
Trespassing! You know that?

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:04.756
Make them leave.

00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:10.236
Don't be ungrateful.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:13.157
When we were kids,

00:14:14.077 --> 00:14:15.077
you helped me fight.

00:14:15.636 --> 00:14:16.636
I'm repaying the favor.

00:14:18.037 --> 00:14:20.077
You remembered such a small matter?

00:14:20.636 --> 00:14:21.516
It's fine. Not needed.

00:14:21.636 --> 00:14:22.596
I don't need that.

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:23.797
But I must return it

00:14:24.236 --> 00:14:26.197
so that I can feel no debts between us.

00:14:26.797 --> 00:14:27.317
I won't move.

00:14:28.797 --> 00:14:29.636
You won't move?

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:30.277
No.

00:14:32.596 --> 00:14:33.157
Fine.

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:35.317
I forgot to tell you.

00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:37.557
The new apartment's neighbor
is Yu Yiming.

00:14:38.116 --> 00:14:39.197
No need to move, guys.

00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:40.077
Move! Move!

00:14:40.116 --> 00:14:40.797
I must move!

00:14:40.957 --> 00:14:42.197
Sorry about earlier.

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:43.476
Let me help you with that.

00:14:43.636 --> 00:14:44.557
Here, I'll pack this.

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:47.636
Who is it?

00:15:03.677 --> 00:15:04.236
Good morning.

00:15:04.996 --> 00:15:05.356
Morning.

00:15:07.917 --> 00:15:08.317
Qiao Lin.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:09.957
Qiao Lin?

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:12.756
You're injured.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:13.596
Your breakfast.

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:16.037
Thanks.

00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:20.077
Have... you eaten? Join me?

00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:20.797
I already ate.

00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:21.636
Oh.

00:15:21.996 --> 00:15:23.356
I'll send you the cafeteria menu.

00:15:23.596 --> 00:15:24.836
You can give me a lunch order.

00:15:25.797 --> 00:15:26.836
- Leaving.
- Bye.

00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:28.996
Bye.

00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:40.689
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital
Staff Cafeteria Weekly Menu)

00:16:00.756 --> 00:16:01.797
Dad, Mom.

00:16:02.876 --> 00:16:03.557
What's wrong?

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.957
It's so late. Why haven't you cooked?

00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:08.677
Do you know

00:16:09.596 --> 00:16:11.636
our whole family
got tricked by that Qiao?

00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:14.836
How?

00:16:15.277 --> 00:16:17.516
I ran into Ms. Chen today on the road.

00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:19.836
She used to work with Wang Yazhen.

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:20.397
Remember her?

00:16:21.516 --> 00:16:23.157
Qiao Jianbin and Wang Yazhen

00:16:23.437 --> 00:16:25.317
bought a storefront on Commercial Street

00:16:25.397 --> 00:16:26.077
for a barbershop.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:27.516
Already paid the down payment.

00:16:28.037 --> 00:16:28.677
Think about it.

00:16:28.917 --> 00:16:29.957
Where is the money from?

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:31.277
How would I know?

00:16:31.677 --> 00:16:33.157
Are you stupid?

00:16:34.157 --> 00:16:35.476
Their family is dirt poor.

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:36.917
How could they afford this?

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.797
Must've used our bride price money!

00:16:40.037 --> 00:16:40.957
Never thought the girl

00:16:41.077 --> 00:16:42.836
who acts so carelessly

00:16:43.317 --> 00:16:45.197
would be so shrewd with money.

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:47.116
Good thing you didn't marry her!

00:16:48.516 --> 00:16:49.596
Listen, son.

00:16:50.157 --> 00:16:52.077
We need to get that money back.

00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:55.077
We can't lose face and money!

00:16:59.472 --> 00:17:00.472
(Qiao Lin, my parents want
the bride price back.)

00:17:00.472 --> 00:17:01.332
(But don't worry, I don't agree.)

00:17:01.332 --> 00:17:02.042
(Because I still love you.)

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:02.542
(I won't hold this against you.)

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:03.536
(I'll come to Jingzhou tomorrow.
Let's meet up.)

00:17:07.024 --> 00:17:08.240
(The message was sent
but rejected by the recipient.)

00:17:10.877 --> 00:17:11.917
She blocked me.

00:17:17.556 --> 00:17:19.877
Sorry, the number you dialed

00:17:19.917 --> 00:17:21.316
is unavailable now.

00:17:21.357 --> 00:17:22.476
Please try again later.

00:17:23.756 --> 00:17:25.437
Phone's blocked too.

00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:26.756
Qiao Lin.

00:17:27.597 --> 00:17:28.516
This is too much.

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:44.036
Hello.

00:17:44.157 --> 00:17:45.637
- Hello.
- I'm looking for

00:17:45.756 --> 00:17:47.476
the host of Family Feast,

00:17:47.597 --> 00:17:48.397
named Qiao Yan.

00:17:49.796 --> 00:17:51.076
She goes by Xu Yan now.

00:17:51.197 --> 00:17:52.637
Do you have an appointment, sir?

00:17:53.316 --> 00:17:53.837
No.

00:17:54.597 --> 00:17:55.157
I'm sorry.

00:17:55.236 --> 00:17:56.837
No visitors without appointments.

00:17:59.197 --> 00:18:01.597
Could you call her to come meet me?

00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:03.716
Her brother-in-law Lin Tao is here.

00:18:04.756 --> 00:18:06.917
You can call her to come get you.

00:18:12.397 --> 00:18:13.076
Thanks then.

00:18:13.236 --> 00:18:14.197
You're welcome, sir.

00:18:21.516 --> 00:18:22.117
Sir.

00:18:22.877 --> 00:18:24.076
Who are you looking for?

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:25.756
Uh...

00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:27.877
I'm looking for Xu Yan,
the host of Family Feast.

00:18:28.397 --> 00:18:29.437
Do you have a pass?

00:18:32.677 --> 00:18:33.716
No entry without a pass.

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:34.957
Please leave now.

00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:35.677
Get out of there.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.476
No, I'll just be a moment.

00:18:37.556 --> 00:18:38.316
Sir, please.

00:18:38.357 --> 00:18:39.117
Leave immediately.

00:18:47.276 --> 00:18:49.437
Thank you so much, Yiming.

00:18:51.877 --> 00:18:53.117
You're very welcome.

00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:55.276
We're high school classmates

00:18:55.397 --> 00:18:56.157
and folks at home.

00:18:56.597 --> 00:18:57.357
In Jingzhou,

00:18:57.397 --> 00:18:58.677
we should help each other.

00:18:59.276 --> 00:18:59.996
Besides,

00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:02.236
Qiao Lin is my patient.

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:05.397
From now on,

00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:06.957
if Qiao Lin needs anything

00:19:06.996 --> 00:19:08.197
or gets in trouble,

00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:10.556
please contact me directly.

00:19:12.516 --> 00:19:12.996
No problem.

00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:17.036
You know,

00:19:17.996 --> 00:19:19.637
Qiao Lin's family and I

00:19:19.677 --> 00:19:20.716
are always like this.

00:19:22.476 --> 00:19:23.236
Thank you.

00:19:24.877 --> 00:19:25.917
Actually, I can tell

00:19:26.637 --> 00:19:28.316
you care deeply about your sister.

00:19:29.677 --> 00:19:32.236
Why don't you just sit down and talk?

00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:33.556
I like it this way.

00:19:34.157 --> 00:19:35.796
We have our own lives,

00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:37.637
keeping a distance,

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:39.157
and being at peace.

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:40.236
It's great.

00:19:49.437 --> 00:19:50.756
Hey, Lin Tao.

00:19:51.276 --> 00:19:51.837
Mr. Qiao,

00:19:54.197 --> 00:19:57.117
do you have Qiao Yan's number?

00:19:57.637 --> 00:19:58.236
Yan?

00:19:59.236 --> 00:20:00.476
Do you need to contact her?

00:20:02.716 --> 00:20:03.397
Yeah.

00:20:04.677 --> 00:20:06.516
Alright, I'll look for it.

00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:14.236
Sir,

00:20:14.837 --> 00:20:15.597
don't bother.

00:20:16.276 --> 00:20:16.957
I got it.

00:20:17.996 --> 00:20:18.556
I know

00:20:19.397 --> 00:20:21.076
you want Qiao Lin and me to be close.

00:20:23.316 --> 00:20:24.597
But it's been too long.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.036
There's no need.

00:20:26.796 --> 00:20:28.157
Qiao Lin just broke up

00:20:28.236 --> 00:20:29.437
and lives alone now.

00:20:30.556 --> 00:20:31.476
With you next door,

00:20:31.516 --> 00:20:32.556
I feel more at ease.

00:20:33.756 --> 00:20:35.597
But please do look after her for me.

00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:37.157
Don't worry.

00:20:37.677 --> 00:20:38.476
It's appropriate

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.117
for me to take care of her.

00:20:40.597 --> 00:20:41.036
Thank you.

00:20:41.756 --> 00:20:42.276
Qiao Yan.

00:20:45.796 --> 00:20:47.076
Why ask him to do that?

00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:48.516
Who is he?

00:20:55.556 --> 00:20:56.117
Who is he?

00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:57.837
Lin Tao, calm down.

00:20:58.197 --> 00:21:00.076
Qiao Lin and I
went to high school with him.

00:21:00.117 --> 00:21:00.677
That's all.

00:21:00.996 --> 00:21:01.476
Hello.

00:21:02.837 --> 00:21:03.556
I'm Yu Yiming.

00:21:04.637 --> 00:21:05.597
High school classmates?

00:21:06.476 --> 00:21:08.756
Then why let Qiao Lin
move next door to him?

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.076
I know why Qiao Lin
called off our engagement.

00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:13.837
You schemed it, didn't you?

00:21:13.837 --> 00:21:14.597
What did I do?

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:16.837
Take this out.

00:21:16.877 --> 00:21:18.157
If you hadn't tricked Qiao Lin,

00:21:18.597 --> 00:21:19.516
why would she come here

00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:20.837
and get close to him?

00:21:21.117 --> 00:21:22.397
Qiao Yan, what's wrong with you?

00:21:22.437 --> 00:21:23.756
This is a public place.

00:21:26.157 --> 00:21:28.476
Go outside, and we'll talk.

00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:29.197
No.

00:21:29.476 --> 00:21:29.877
Qiao Yan.

00:21:30.397 --> 00:21:31.437
What's wrong with you?

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.157
Wait, hold on a second.

00:21:36.197 --> 00:21:36.677
Wait.

00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:39.157
You pushed me!

00:21:39.597 --> 00:21:41.716
You seduced my fiancée,
and now you're pushing me?

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:42.437
Qiao Yan.

00:21:42.837 --> 00:21:44.316
You helped your sister cheat.

00:21:44.597 --> 00:21:46.117
You two are disgusting.

00:21:46.157 --> 00:21:47.236
Watch your mouth.

00:21:47.397 --> 00:21:47.996
Go outside.

00:21:48.197 --> 00:21:48.677
No.

00:21:48.996 --> 00:21:50.316
Say it here.

00:21:50.556 --> 00:21:51.756
Where is Qiao Lin really?

00:21:51.996 --> 00:21:52.957
Get her here

00:21:53.117 --> 00:21:54.437
and explain everything.

00:21:54.637 --> 00:21:56.397
I want every detail laid out clearly.

00:21:56.437 --> 00:21:57.316
I know where she is.

00:21:59.397 --> 00:22:00.197
I'll take you there.

00:22:05.276 --> 00:22:05.796
Go ahead.

00:22:16.556 --> 00:22:17.276
No lying, huh?

00:22:20.157 --> 00:22:20.877
What happened?

00:22:20.877 --> 00:22:21.316
Sorry.

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:22.276
I'm not sure.

00:22:22.476 --> 00:22:23.476
Ask this gentleman.

00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:25.236
Sorry, are your clothes alright?

00:22:25.597 --> 00:22:26.316
Yeah, thank you.

00:22:26.877 --> 00:22:27.516
Hey, handsome.

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:29.837
What happened here earlier?

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:31.316
You are...

00:22:31.796 --> 00:22:33.197
I'm Xu Yan's colleague.

00:22:33.357 --> 00:22:35.437
I saw a man leave with her just now.

00:22:35.476 --> 00:22:36.276
Are they...

00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:37.996
I don't know them.

00:22:38.236 --> 00:22:39.637
They bumped into me just now.

00:22:40.036 --> 00:22:40.637
Sorry.

00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:49.917
You teamed up

00:22:49.957 --> 00:22:51.197
to help her cheat on me, huh?

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.597
This matter won't be
swept under the rug.

00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:55.637
What I just said simply

00:22:57.036 --> 00:22:59.076
went through one ear
and out the other, right?

00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:00.556
Get her here

00:23:01.397 --> 00:23:02.357
to explain it to me.

00:23:02.556 --> 00:23:04.276
She'll swear that she has

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:05.716
no romance with that Yu.

00:23:05.796 --> 00:23:06.516
You're pathetic.

00:23:06.837 --> 00:23:07.556
Scared, huh?

00:23:08.837 --> 00:23:09.996
Afraid she'll slip up.

00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:12.036
Qiao Yan, you never speak the truth.

00:23:18.556 --> 00:23:19.157
I'm leaving.

00:23:19.837 --> 00:23:21.197
Two final things for you.

00:23:21.556 --> 00:23:22.036
First,

00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:24.796
you've broken up with Qiao Lin.

00:23:25.877 --> 00:23:27.197
You have no connection anymore.

00:23:27.276 --> 00:23:28.036
- I...
- Second,

00:23:28.597 --> 00:23:30.917
I forbid you from meddling in
her current life.

00:23:32.357 --> 00:23:33.556
I'm done. Understood?

00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:37.397
Firstly,

00:23:38.197 --> 00:23:39.957
the breakup was her unilateral decision.

00:23:40.197 --> 00:23:40.957
I never agreed.

00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:42.677
How can we have no connection?

00:23:43.076 --> 00:23:44.076
She's my fiancée!

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:46.076
Your family accepted the bride price!

00:23:49.917 --> 00:23:50.516
How much?

00:23:51.076 --> 00:23:51.597
I'll pay.

00:23:55.556 --> 00:23:56.877
This isn't about money!

00:23:56.957 --> 00:23:58.276
I want her! Her!

00:23:59.276 --> 00:23:59.957
I don't know.

00:24:02.236 --> 00:24:02.756
Fine.

00:24:04.197 --> 00:24:04.877
Won't talk?

00:24:05.756 --> 00:24:06.837
Then I'll come every day.

00:24:07.076 --> 00:24:08.476
I'll demand her at your workplace.

00:24:08.597 --> 00:24:09.796
Hound your in-laws for her.

00:24:10.397 --> 00:24:11.476
Didn't you marry well?

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:12.957
I'll show them what kind

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:13.996
of shameless things

00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:15.696
you've been doing behind their backs.

00:24:25.437 --> 00:24:26.076
Suit yourself.

00:24:36.437 --> 00:24:36.996
Coming.

00:24:45.437 --> 00:24:45.917
I'll get it.

00:24:57.437 --> 00:24:58.197
Good grief!

00:24:59.996 --> 00:25:02.197
He's completely insane!

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.357
Always looked down on me,

00:25:05.716 --> 00:25:08.076
saying I couldn't help his career,

00:25:08.476 --> 00:25:10.197
now falsely accusing me of cheating!

00:25:10.276 --> 00:25:10.716
Well,

00:25:10.957 --> 00:25:11.476
such madness!

00:25:11.728 --> 00:25:12.516
I'm so pissed off!

00:25:15.236 --> 00:25:16.276
What will you do?

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.957
He wants me to confront him directly?

00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:20.516
Fine.

00:25:20.756 --> 00:25:21.597
Talk to him directly.

00:25:21.716 --> 00:25:22.716
Watch me beat him hard!

00:25:27.197 --> 00:25:28.236
I won't recommend that.

00:25:29.357 --> 00:25:31.440
It's unnecessary for you
to drain yourself like this.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.516
Since you broke up,

00:25:33.877 --> 00:25:35.796
make a clean break from the past.

00:25:37.197 --> 00:25:38.117
I talked with Lin Tao.

00:25:38.917 --> 00:25:39.796
What he cares about

00:25:40.157 --> 00:25:42.076
is your emotional loyalty to him.

00:25:42.197 --> 00:25:45.316
But his parents only
care about the money.

00:25:47.076 --> 00:25:48.516
Don't worry about the money.

00:25:48.917 --> 00:25:49.996
I'll handle it for you.

00:25:50.437 --> 00:25:51.197
This way,

00:25:51.796 --> 00:25:53.197
even if he causes trouble here,

00:25:53.837 --> 00:25:55.036
his parents will stop him.

00:25:57.877 --> 00:25:59.437
I don't need your help with this.

00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:00.516
I'll handle it myself.

00:26:00.677 --> 00:26:01.276
How exactly?

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:04.276
When will you handle it?

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:06.476
With what?

00:26:07.236 --> 00:26:07.677
I...

00:26:17.917 --> 00:26:19.877
By the time you got the money,

00:26:20.677 --> 00:26:21.957
Lin Tao would have made this

00:26:21.996 --> 00:26:23.076
public knowledge by then.

00:26:23.996 --> 00:26:25.397
By then, my workplace,

00:26:25.677 --> 00:26:26.316
the Shen family,

00:26:26.597 --> 00:26:27.796
and everyone else would know.

00:26:30.197 --> 00:26:30.556
I...

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:31.837
I thought

00:26:31.837 --> 00:26:33.476
you were considering my interests.

00:26:33.837 --> 00:26:36.080
Turns out you're just afraid
your lies will be exposed.

00:26:40.197 --> 00:26:40.716
Yes.

00:26:43.677 --> 00:26:44.957
I did it for myself.

00:26:48.157 --> 00:26:49.157
Because since childhood,

00:26:49.197 --> 00:26:50.877
I've had to learn to prioritize myself.

00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:52.036
I'm not you.

00:26:55.796 --> 00:26:57.556
I don't need you causing
more trouble for me.

00:26:58.516 --> 00:27:00.036
If money can solve it,

00:27:00.197 --> 00:27:01.076
I'll handle it.

00:27:01.877 --> 00:27:03.824
Fine. I won't cause you trouble.

00:27:05.157 --> 00:27:06.357
Consider this money a loan.

00:27:06.516 --> 00:27:08.197
The rent for the apartment
is also a loan.

00:27:08.236 --> 00:27:09.796
I'll pay you back in installments.

00:27:10.236 --> 00:27:10.877
Qiao Lin.

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:11.756
What?

00:27:11.888 --> 00:27:13.516
What do you ever do
besides acting tough?

00:27:13.516 --> 00:27:14.036
I don't.

00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:15.397
- Look at your arm!
- I...

00:27:43.837 --> 00:27:45.157
Who is this Lin Tao?

00:27:46.117 --> 00:27:47.117
Claims to be your wife's

00:27:47.157 --> 00:27:48.197
cousin's fiancé.

00:27:50.677 --> 00:27:53.556
Investigate his employment status
and social connections.

00:27:54.516 --> 00:27:54.996
Understood.

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:04.197
Son, all the money's been transferred.

00:28:04.437 --> 00:28:06.637
If there's nothing in Jingzhou,
come home immediately.

00:28:07.076 --> 00:28:09.516
I'm not going back.
I need to stay here a few more days.

00:28:10.597 --> 00:28:11.556
Quit while you're ahead.

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:14.117
Her sister has quite the influence.

00:28:14.157 --> 00:28:15.076
Don't make enemies.

00:28:15.677 --> 00:28:16.157
Exactly.

00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:16.716
Mom, Dad,

00:28:17.157 --> 00:28:18.117
if I don't find out

00:28:18.157 --> 00:28:19.917
whether Qiao Lin called off the wedding

00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:20.957
because she has an affair,

00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:21.957
I'm never going back!

00:28:22.677 --> 00:28:23.280
I'll hang up.

00:28:24.837 --> 00:28:25.397
Lin Tao,

00:28:26.096 --> 00:28:27.276
the reason I called you here

00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:29.397
is to inform you the leadership

00:28:29.516 --> 00:28:30.957
values your development highly.

00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:32.397
Keep working hard.

00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:33.197
Understood?

00:28:33.556 --> 00:28:34.117
Sir,

00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:38.597
you dragged me back
from Jingzhou for this?

00:28:41.197 --> 00:28:42.796
Sir, when I asked for leave,

00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:44.397
I explained in Jingzhou,

00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:45.877
I have urgent family matters.

00:28:45.996 --> 00:28:46.917
Why make me...?

00:28:46.957 --> 00:28:48.957
Isn't this about
the account reconciliation?

00:28:49.157 --> 00:28:50.276
We need you.

00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:52.957
Well,

00:28:54.157 --> 00:28:56.076
account reconciliation
isn't my responsibility.

00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:58.157
It's the emphasis
on your career development.

00:28:58.637 --> 00:28:59.556
Enough. Stop arguing.

00:29:00.437 --> 00:29:01.837
Your leave request is denied.

00:29:02.316 --> 00:29:03.197
You're staying here.

00:29:03.597 --> 00:29:04.756
Why?

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:08.476
To be honest,

00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:11.197
this leave request wasn't denied by me.

00:29:12.236 --> 00:29:13.556
Mr. Zhou rejected it.

00:29:14.597 --> 00:29:15.276
Mr. Zhou?

00:29:16.877 --> 00:29:17.837
How did my leave request

00:29:17.917 --> 00:29:18.996
reach the executive level?

00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.076
I don't know.

00:29:20.397 --> 00:29:21.877
Mr. Zhou called me this morning

00:29:21.957 --> 00:29:22.677
asking about you.

00:29:23.117 --> 00:29:24.357
I said you'd taken leave.

00:29:25.357 --> 00:29:27.316
Leadership showed great concern,

00:29:27.637 --> 00:29:29.637
telling me to recall you immediately.

00:29:30.197 --> 00:29:31.197
They praised you

00:29:31.516 --> 00:29:33.516
and told me to assign you
more responsibilities.

00:29:40.117 --> 00:29:40.637
Lin Tao,

00:29:41.756 --> 00:29:42.957
tell me the truth.

00:29:43.397 --> 00:29:45.756
What's your relationship with Mr. Zhou?

00:29:46.756 --> 00:29:47.796
Nothing's going on.

00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:48.877
Nothing?

00:29:49.197 --> 00:29:50.796
But he specifically inquired about you.

00:29:52.837 --> 00:29:53.397
Tao,

00:29:54.036 --> 00:29:55.197
stop pretending with me.

00:29:56.716 --> 00:29:57.957
The boss cares a lot about you.

00:29:58.276 --> 00:30:00.117
You'll have a bright future ahead.

00:30:01.437 --> 00:30:01.996
From now on,

00:30:01.996 --> 00:30:03.312
don't take unnecessary leaves.

00:30:03.312 --> 00:30:04.677
It looks bad for your reputation.

00:30:05.677 --> 00:30:07.036
Alright. Get back to work.

00:30:07.637 --> 00:30:08.357
Go on.

00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:18.957
Honey, are you ready?

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:20.117
Almost there.

00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:21.837
I'll count down from five.

00:30:22.276 --> 00:30:22.796
Don't!

00:30:22.796 --> 00:30:23.316
Five.

00:30:23.677 --> 00:30:24.157
No counting.

00:30:24.157 --> 00:30:24.677
Four.

00:30:24.677 --> 00:30:25.397
Stop counting.

00:30:25.397 --> 00:30:25.957
Three.

00:30:26.197 --> 00:30:26.637
Two.

00:30:26.957 --> 00:30:27.397
One.

00:30:29.397 --> 00:30:29.837
Done.

00:30:31.076 --> 00:30:32.516
You cheated!

00:30:34.476 --> 00:30:36.197
You didn't even finish the count.

00:30:37.076 --> 00:30:38.276
What kind of

00:30:39.996 --> 00:30:40.917
dish

00:30:42.677 --> 00:30:43.917
is this?

00:30:44.236 --> 00:30:45.076
Isn't it obvious?

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.608
Shrimp-stuffed potato chips.

00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:49.677
Why such a literal name?

00:30:50.637 --> 00:30:51.877
They're delicious, really.

00:30:51.996 --> 00:30:52.437
Try one.

00:30:54.157 --> 00:30:54.637
Well?

00:30:56.276 --> 00:30:56.756
Good?

00:30:57.437 --> 00:30:57.957
As expected,

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.556
the chips taste like chips.

00:31:01.597 --> 00:31:03.357
The shrimp tastes like shrimp.

00:31:04.716 --> 00:31:05.756
Say it seriously.

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:08.236
This will be the featured dish
in my next episode.

00:31:08.637 --> 00:31:09.712
It's really that bad?

00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:12.397
That's my fault.

00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:14.036
Let me try another piece.

00:31:15.632 --> 00:31:18.464
♪To reignite♪

00:31:18.637 --> 00:31:19.197
Different now.

00:31:20.637 --> 00:31:21.837
The chips carry shrimp flavor.

00:31:22.637 --> 00:31:24.316
The shrimp tastes potatoey.

00:31:25.397 --> 00:31:26.756
Just like you and me.

00:31:27.076 --> 00:31:28.996
You carry traces of me.
I carry traces of you.

00:31:28.996 --> 00:31:29.917
Mixed together.

00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:30.556
Amazing.

00:31:31.117 --> 00:31:31.437
Okay.

00:31:31.597 --> 00:31:32.197
Alright.

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.397
Let me taste your dish.

00:31:35.357 --> 00:31:35.917
Codfish.

00:31:36.556 --> 00:31:37.117
Have a bite.

00:31:37.157 --> 00:31:37.756
Wait.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:39.236
This isn't ordinary cod.

00:31:39.316 --> 00:31:39.756
What is it?

00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:42.357
It's Shen-family secret recipe cod.

00:31:42.397 --> 00:31:43.316
Extraordinary cod.

00:31:43.516 --> 00:31:43.996
Taste it.

00:31:47.036 --> 00:31:48.556
Let me name this cod dish. Okay?

00:31:48.837 --> 00:31:49.157
Fine.

00:31:49.556 --> 00:31:50.117
We'll call it

00:31:51.197 --> 00:31:52.516
Charcoal in Snowstorm?

00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:53.957
It's completely charred.

00:31:56.036 --> 00:31:56.996
That's a terrible pun.

00:31:57.476 --> 00:31:58.316
Here, try it.

00:31:58.597 --> 00:31:58.917
Fine.

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:08.316
Perfectly preserves
the cod's natural fishiness.

00:32:08.476 --> 00:32:09.076
Very good.

00:32:24.036 --> 00:32:25.357
(Given Lin Tao's personality,)

00:32:26.157 --> 00:32:27.677
(I thought he'd keep pressing.)

00:32:28.877 --> 00:32:30.036
(But unexpectedly,)

00:32:30.796 --> 00:32:31.996
(he suddenly vanished.)

00:32:44.036 --> 00:32:45.996
I contacted Mr. Huang's office.

00:32:46.437 --> 00:32:49.236
They said he is going abroad
for inspection.

00:32:49.397 --> 00:32:50.437
His schedule's packed.

00:32:50.917 --> 00:32:52.076
Can't arrange a meeting now.

00:32:53.236 --> 00:32:54.316
I also heard...

00:32:54.837 --> 00:32:55.516
Heard what?

00:32:59.316 --> 00:33:00.157
Out with it.

00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:00.837
Speak.

00:33:01.996 --> 00:33:03.516
Mr. Huang calls you the heir apparent.

00:33:10.677 --> 00:33:12.197
He knows my funding's limited.

00:33:13.008 --> 00:33:14.256
I have insufficient influence.

00:33:14.357 --> 00:33:15.437
He is clearly avoiding me.

00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:17.036
What's our next step?

00:33:17.677 --> 00:33:19.036
Keep pursuing him?

00:33:19.996 --> 00:33:21.877
Proceed as planned.

00:33:22.476 --> 00:33:24.516
Thoroughly study
his company's structure.

00:33:24.637 --> 00:33:25.157
Okay.

00:33:27.856 --> 00:33:30.110
(Plot Plan)

00:33:32.796 --> 00:33:33.556
In short,

00:33:33.756 --> 00:33:35.716
we shouldn't rush on this land deal.

00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:37.197
Listen to your father.

00:33:38.597 --> 00:33:39.716
If he doesn't approve,

00:33:39.996 --> 00:33:42.117
Mr. Huang from Shouke
won't risk partnering with you.

00:33:42.117 --> 00:33:42.556
Right?

00:33:44.917 --> 00:33:45.316
Alright.

00:33:45.637 --> 00:33:46.437
Don't overthink it.

00:33:46.796 --> 00:33:47.716
He's your father.

00:33:48.197 --> 00:33:49.397
Every decision he makes

00:33:49.476 --> 00:33:50.516
is for your benefit.

00:33:50.716 --> 00:33:52.917
Tonight he's hosting Shifeng people
for dinner at home.

00:33:53.597 --> 00:33:55.197
Don't let your emotions show.

00:33:57.796 --> 00:33:58.512
Give us a smile.

00:33:59.316 --> 00:33:59.837
Got it.

00:34:03.877 --> 00:34:04.357
Mom.

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:05.036
Haoming.

00:34:05.236 --> 00:34:06.036
Have some fruits.

00:34:06.637 --> 00:34:07.516
You're back.

00:34:10.996 --> 00:34:13.116
You two chat first.
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:13.757
Alright.

00:34:17.676 --> 00:34:18.076
Sit.

00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:22.036
What were you talking with Mom?

00:34:23.556 --> 00:34:24.336
Nothing important.

00:34:24.837 --> 00:34:25.996
Just some minor work stuff.

00:34:28.917 --> 00:34:29.277
Good boy.

00:34:29.596 --> 00:34:30.277
Have some water.

00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:31.036
Pass me Bu.

00:34:31.917 --> 00:34:32.516
Bu!

00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:33.957
Let's go, Bu!

00:34:37.437 --> 00:34:38.116
Can you sit?

00:34:38.917 --> 00:34:39.516
Can you sit?

00:34:40.156 --> 00:34:40.516
Sit.

00:34:41.277 --> 00:34:41.636
Sit.

00:34:42.757 --> 00:34:43.312
Shake hands.

00:34:43.877 --> 00:34:44.797
Shake hands.

00:34:46.397 --> 00:34:46.797
Come on.

00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:48.556
Come on, shake hands.

00:34:50.516 --> 00:34:51.277
Such a good boy.

00:35:09.196 --> 00:35:10.128
Where are we going?

00:35:11.116 --> 00:35:12.036
You'll see soon.

00:35:13.156 --> 00:35:13.516
Let's go.

00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:20.797
You found it.

00:35:21.797 --> 00:35:23.317
I stumbled upon it accidentally.

00:35:24.196 --> 00:35:25.156
I asked Hui.

00:35:25.476 --> 00:35:27.156
She said you made this as a child.

00:35:28.476 --> 00:35:28.996
Yeah.

00:35:30.116 --> 00:35:31.516
This thing's pretty old.

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:33.556
When I was in elementary school,

00:35:34.357 --> 00:35:36.277
my dad wanted to renovate this villa.

00:35:36.757 --> 00:35:38.996
They made this opening
and planned to fix it,

00:35:39.476 --> 00:35:40.277
but I stopped them.

00:35:40.957 --> 00:35:42.076
Then I made this instead.

00:35:48.717 --> 00:35:50.757
How did you have such
good craftsmanship as a child?

00:35:53.676 --> 00:35:54.636
A little bear,

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:58.556
a small window.

00:36:00.717 --> 00:36:02.237
It's gazing outside,

00:36:02.837 --> 00:36:03.877
hiding here,

00:36:05.397 --> 00:36:06.596
looking so lonely.

00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:09.277
Maybe it wants

00:36:09.397 --> 00:36:11.196
to hide all the disappointments
and sadness

00:36:11.237 --> 00:36:12.476
here inside.

00:36:13.317 --> 00:36:14.877
Stay hidden and slowly process them,

00:36:15.636 --> 00:36:17.957
only showing the happy side to others.

00:36:20.717 --> 00:36:21.797
That's why I...

00:36:25.636 --> 00:36:27.036
I added this little lamp,

00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:31.237
hoping

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.636
it could chase away
those gloomy feelings

00:36:37.277 --> 00:36:38.237
and end its loneliness.

00:36:46.556 --> 00:36:47.357
Haoming,

00:36:51.237 --> 00:36:52.476
I know you care about me,

00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:55.676
but I don't need you

00:36:56.996 --> 00:36:59.437
to shield me from all your troubles

00:36:59.556 --> 00:37:00.596
and worries.

00:37:02.516 --> 00:37:04.036
I want to share your burdens

00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:05.397
and anxieties with you.

00:37:08.516 --> 00:37:09.357
Your happiness

00:37:10.636 --> 00:37:11.797
makes me happier.

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:27.196
Thank you.

00:37:48.944 --> 00:37:52.184
(Jingzhou Conrad Hotel)

00:37:53.596 --> 00:37:55.636
Mr. Huang from Shouke Real Estate

00:37:57.757 --> 00:37:59.196
is notoriously difficult.

00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:02.156
I'm quite social-savvy,

00:38:02.317 --> 00:38:03.437
but dealing with him

00:38:03.797 --> 00:38:05.156
is like hitting a brick wall.

00:38:05.797 --> 00:38:07.196
He's such an eccentric person.

00:38:09.277 --> 00:38:10.636
If he's eccentric,

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:14.317
there must be some special backstory.

00:38:15.036 --> 00:38:16.917
That's why you're smart, Miss Xu.

00:38:17.717 --> 00:38:18.797
My husband mentioned

00:38:19.277 --> 00:38:21.808
that Mr. Huang has an extraordinary
relationship with his wife.

00:38:22.516 --> 00:38:23.676
In their circle,

00:38:23.996 --> 00:38:25.676
he's known for being a devoted husband.

00:38:26.036 --> 00:38:26.636
Later,

00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:28.156
his wife fell seriously ill.

00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:30.476
Mr. Huang abandoned
all business affairs.

00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:31.917
He accompanied his wife,

00:38:31.917 --> 00:38:33.957
seeking medical help
both domestically and abroad.

00:38:34.556 --> 00:38:35.116
In the end,

00:38:35.357 --> 00:38:37.437
his wife still passed away.

00:38:38.317 --> 00:38:39.877
Mr. Huang was devastated.

00:38:40.196 --> 00:38:41.717
His temperament changed.

00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:44.397
He never remarried.

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.237
From what you say,

00:38:48.437 --> 00:38:49.957
Mr. Huang seems decent.

00:38:50.357 --> 00:38:51.357
He has good character.

00:38:52.116 --> 00:38:52.837
Meiling,

00:38:53.877 --> 00:38:54.996
do you know

00:38:55.156 --> 00:38:56.516
if he has any living relatives?

00:38:57.156 --> 00:38:57.996
Even extended family?

00:38:58.196 --> 00:38:59.437
There's hardly anyone left.

00:39:00.076 --> 00:39:01.516
The couple never had children.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.877
His mother-in-law is still alive.

00:39:04.277 --> 00:39:05.636
I've heard all these years

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.996
he's been caring for her diligently.

00:39:08.196 --> 00:39:09.717
He wants to be her caretaker for life.

00:39:09.957 --> 00:39:12.277
But the old lady is stubborn.

00:39:12.757 --> 00:39:14.076
She moved to a nursing home.

00:39:14.437 --> 00:39:16.476
Mr. Huang couldn't change her mind,

00:39:16.837 --> 00:39:18.156
so he relented.

00:39:22.437 --> 00:39:23.757
In these business circles,

00:39:24.757 --> 00:39:26.476
is there anything you don't know?

00:39:26.917 --> 00:39:27.596
Not much.

00:39:34.996 --> 00:39:35.717
Miss Xu,

00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:37.317
thank you so much

00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:39.476
for donating these supplies
to our nursing home.

00:39:39.996 --> 00:39:40.516
Ms. Han,

00:39:41.076 --> 00:39:43.556
they're just daily necessities.
No need for formalities.

00:39:44.596 --> 00:39:45.277
Actually,

00:39:45.397 --> 00:39:47.036
I should be thanking you

00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:50.116
for letting us contribute.

00:39:50.397 --> 00:39:51.156
It's not easy.

00:39:56.357 --> 00:39:56.996
By the way,

00:39:57.676 --> 00:39:59.076
do you have a resident here

00:39:59.237 --> 00:40:00.717
named Yu Shufen?

00:40:01.156 --> 00:40:01.837
Yu Shufen?

00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:03.036
You know her?

00:40:03.676 --> 00:40:05.392
She's someone
my husband respected deeply.

00:40:05.757 --> 00:40:07.156
I'd like to visit her.

00:40:09.317 --> 00:40:10.036
Well...

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:12.757
Is there an issue?

00:40:13.676 --> 00:40:14.797
Not really.

00:40:15.237 --> 00:40:16.237
I just think

00:40:16.596 --> 00:40:17.877
your visit might be...

00:40:23.317 --> 00:40:23.957
Get out!

00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:25.156
Get away from me!

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.996
Don't blame me!

00:40:27.636 --> 00:40:28.596
It's your own fault!

00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:29.476
You thief!

00:40:29.516 --> 00:40:30.196
Shameless!

00:40:30.317 --> 00:40:31.476
I told you to leave!

00:40:31.757 --> 00:40:32.237
You...

00:40:32.516 --> 00:40:33.516
I've said everything!

00:40:33.596 --> 00:40:34.277
Not leaving?

00:40:34.877 --> 00:40:35.917
Stop following me!

00:40:36.277 --> 00:40:37.277
Utterly shameless!

00:40:37.397 --> 00:40:38.476
So thick-skinned!

00:40:38.877 --> 00:40:40.397
How dare you steal from me!

00:40:40.717 --> 00:40:41.516
Back off!

00:40:42.036 --> 00:40:42.877
I'll beat you up!

00:40:43.156 --> 00:40:44.156
Utterly shameless!

00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:45.797
What's left to steal?

00:40:46.476 --> 00:40:47.397
You're shameless!

00:40:47.437 --> 00:40:48.476
Stop dodging!

00:40:48.757 --> 00:40:50.237
Stop dodging!

00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:51.516
Miss Xu,

00:40:51.596 --> 00:40:52.877
this is Yu Shufen.

00:40:53.556 --> 00:40:54.596
Alzheimer's disease,

00:40:55.196 --> 00:40:56.476
mid-to-late stage.

00:40:57.397 --> 00:40:58.596
As you know,

00:40:59.357 --> 00:41:00.596
for patients like this,

00:41:01.036 --> 00:41:03.917
we can only provide

00:41:03.917 --> 00:41:05.036
a comfortable environment.

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:08.437
Caregivers guide them through

00:41:09.397 --> 00:41:11.036
Baduanjin exercises

00:41:11.397 --> 00:41:12.357
and finger exercises.

00:41:12.917 --> 00:41:16.076
This helps slow
the disease's progression.

00:41:17.237 --> 00:41:17.957
I said

00:41:19.357 --> 00:41:20.036
leave!

00:41:23.116 --> 00:41:23.917
Meatballs!

00:41:40.116 --> 00:41:44.596
One, two, three, four...

00:41:45.397 --> 00:41:47.556
What's Madam Yu holding?

00:41:48.596 --> 00:41:49.957
Counting vegetable balls.

00:41:50.917 --> 00:41:51.837
Vegetable balls.

00:41:59.837 --> 00:42:00.917
Grandma!

00:42:00.957 --> 00:42:02.156
Are the vegetable balls ready?

00:42:02.196 --> 00:42:03.837
I'll be late for school.

00:42:04.996 --> 00:42:06.437
Almost done.

00:42:07.156 --> 00:42:08.196
You insisted

00:42:08.277 --> 00:42:09.996
on having fried vegetable balls.

00:42:10.237 --> 00:42:13.476
This dish requires a lot of effort.

00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:14.556
We have to take it slow.

00:42:15.676 --> 00:42:16.437
It's ready.

00:42:17.717 --> 00:42:18.717
One.

00:42:19.237 --> 00:42:20.357
Two.

00:42:20.877 --> 00:42:21.797
Three.

00:42:22.357 --> 00:42:23.357
Four.

00:42:23.437 --> 00:42:24.437
Five.

00:42:24.636 --> 00:42:26.076
Lately, we don't know why,

00:42:26.596 --> 00:42:28.837
but the old lady keeps using
soil from flowerpots

00:42:28.877 --> 00:42:29.877
to make mud balls.

00:42:30.357 --> 00:42:32.277
She claims they're her vegetable balls.

00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:35.556
Flowerpot soil.

00:42:36.277 --> 00:42:38.516
If accidentally eaten, isn't it unsafe?

00:42:38.596 --> 00:42:39.957
At first, we were worried too.

00:42:40.317 --> 00:42:41.877
We tried taking the mud balls

00:42:42.076 --> 00:42:43.036
while she was asleep.

00:42:43.437 --> 00:42:44.717
But after waking up

00:42:44.877 --> 00:42:46.156
and finding them missing,

00:42:46.277 --> 00:42:47.237
she threw a tantrum.

00:42:47.676 --> 00:42:48.996
Said they were for her daughter.

00:42:49.036 --> 00:42:49.676
In the end,

00:42:49.917 --> 00:42:52.116
his wife still passed away.

00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:53.076
We realized

00:42:53.196 --> 00:42:54.397
she never actually ate them.

00:42:54.877 --> 00:42:56.277
So we let her be.

00:43:00.196 --> 00:43:01.357
Making vegetable balls?

00:43:01.757 --> 00:43:03.837
Why this sudden craving?

00:43:03.957 --> 00:43:04.957
Just felt like eating

00:43:05.556 --> 00:43:06.957
your homemade vegetable balls.

00:43:07.076 --> 00:43:08.317
Missing your cooking.

00:43:09.596 --> 00:43:09.996
Alright.

00:43:10.757 --> 00:43:11.317
Take a look.

00:43:12.277 --> 00:43:12.717
Enough?

00:43:13.476 --> 00:43:14.797
With this big bowl of yours,

00:43:15.116 --> 00:43:16.437
you could make five platters!

00:43:16.877 --> 00:43:17.556
First step,

00:43:17.757 --> 00:43:18.837
add white sugar.

00:43:19.437 --> 00:43:20.036
Adding sugar.

00:43:20.076 --> 00:43:21.596
To draw out moisture.

00:43:25.917 --> 00:43:26.797
Mix evenly, right?

00:43:27.116 --> 00:43:28.036
Of course!

00:43:28.116 --> 00:43:29.196
Need to repeat?

00:43:29.237 --> 00:43:30.676
Mix it.

00:43:31.357 --> 00:43:32.036
See?

00:43:32.516 --> 00:43:34.437
Told you to come to Jingzhou.

00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:36.156
I've said it many times.

00:43:36.797 --> 00:43:37.516
If you're here,

00:43:37.556 --> 00:43:38.996
you'd be sitting here with me,

00:43:39.076 --> 00:43:40.156
teaching me directly.

00:43:40.237 --> 00:43:41.317
I learn fast!

00:43:43.476 --> 00:43:44.516
You stay put.

00:43:44.556 --> 00:43:45.317
I'm not going.

00:43:45.397 --> 00:43:46.757
I'm busy now.

00:43:47.797 --> 00:43:48.957
These days,

00:43:49.156 --> 00:43:50.237
I'm busy playing mahjong.

00:43:51.156 --> 00:43:53.116
The neighborhood ladies say,

00:43:53.437 --> 00:43:54.636
"Madam, at your age,

00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:56.277
you should exercise your mind."

00:43:56.996 --> 00:43:57.917
Alright.

00:43:58.837 --> 00:43:59.957
I know

00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:03.156
you have an exciting senior life.

00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:05.996
I won't keep you

00:44:06.076 --> 00:44:07.437
from your joyful golden years.

00:44:08.237 --> 00:44:09.357
After mixing,

00:44:09.596 --> 00:44:10.676
drain the water.

00:44:10.797 --> 00:44:11.476
Then chop.

00:44:11.596 --> 00:44:13.116
After chopping, add seasoning.

00:44:13.357 --> 00:44:14.957
Chinese five-spice, allspice.

00:44:15.036 --> 00:44:16.116
And some salt.

00:44:16.237 --> 00:44:17.076
Also add eggs.

00:44:17.357 --> 00:44:18.676
Don't over-salt!

00:44:19.036 --> 00:44:19.676
Wait!

00:44:19.676 --> 00:44:20.516
Slow down!

00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:21.516
Speak slower.

00:44:21.596 --> 00:44:23.556
Slow down.

00:44:23.636 --> 00:44:25.237
My brain can't keep up with yours.

00:44:25.317 --> 00:44:27.277
You play Go and chess daily.

00:44:29.437 --> 00:44:31.717
So you forget things too?

00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:34.397
You used to complain about me.

00:44:34.757 --> 00:44:36.516
"You never remember what I tell you!"

00:44:37.196 --> 00:44:38.556
Now it's your turn.

00:44:39.837 --> 00:44:40.556
