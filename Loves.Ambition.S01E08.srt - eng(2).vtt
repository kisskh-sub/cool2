Madam Yu.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.059
Madam Yu.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.898
I brought a cake for you.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.299
Who are you?

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.619
My name is Xu Yan.

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.858
I brought you
a delicious osmanthus cake.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:23.619
Madam Yu.

00:02:24.698 --> 00:02:27.059
The cake I made is an osmanthus cake.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.299
It includes the osmanthus jam
my grandma made.

00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:31.858
And my grandma said

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.739
that having sweets occasionally

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.299
makes people happy.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.019
But don't worry. It's not too sweet.

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:47.538
Wipe your hands?

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.019
Madam Yu, guess what?

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:53.578
You and my grandma

00:02:54.098 --> 00:02:56.779
were born in the same year,
the Year of the Ox.

00:03:02.378 --> 00:03:04.219
Coincidentally,
your experiences are similar.

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.019
You both contributed
to the borderland construction

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:12.418
and were among the first people
to support Xinjiang. What a coincidence!

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:16.378
We were

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.098
born in new China
and grew up under the national flag.

00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:24.499
We devoted our lives
to the country's modernization.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:25.378
Right,

00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:29.138
the country's modernization.

00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:30.418
That's impressive.

00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:31.899
Alright.

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.658
Madam Yu, try the osmanthus cake.

00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:48.418
Want to taste it?

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:54.858
Who are you?
How did you get into my room?

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.939
My name is Xu Yan.

00:03:59.418 --> 00:04:00.658
I'm here to see you.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.378
I brought an osmanthus cake.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.098
- You're a thief.
- I'm not a thief.

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:04.899
You're stealing.

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:05.939
Madam Yu, I'm not a thief.

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:07.019
Listen to me, Madam Yu.

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:09.698
- You want to steal vegetable balls.
- I got you vegetable balls.

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:11.899
Madam Yu, I brought vegetable balls.

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:14.098
Your daughter's favorite food.

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:19.458
Vegetable balls? My vegetable balls.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.539
One, two, three, four,

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:35.778
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:39.659
Right amount.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.619
All here.

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:56.258
Vegetable balls.

00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:58.179
It's warm.

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:04.378
Want to try it?

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:14.179
See if it tastes
like those you make. Taste it.

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:19.859
Vegetable balls.

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.338
My daughter's favorite vegetable balls.

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.539
My daughter loves vegetable balls.

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:46.499
You...

00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:50.739
What happened

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:51.659
to you?

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:56.939
I did it by accident.

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.179
It's because

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:02.778
the osmanthus cake is very delicious.

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:03.778
Really.

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.378
It smells so good.

00:06:07.338 --> 00:06:08.059
Have a taste.

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.338
Try a bite.

00:06:24.778 --> 00:06:25.578
Is it tasty?

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.099
- It's tasty.
- Tasty.

00:06:36.378 --> 00:06:37.299
Who are you?

00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:41.179
Xu Yan.

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:47.539
If you like,

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.218
I can often bring you vegetable balls.

00:06:57.258 --> 00:06:57.778
Okay.

00:06:58.378 --> 00:07:01.218
Have another bite.
It contains osmanthus jam.

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:06.458
It's tasty.

00:07:08.018 --> 00:07:09.258
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.040
(Family Feast)

00:07:22.698 --> 00:07:23.619
Have some fruit.

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:26.419
Madam Yu.

00:07:27.138 --> 00:07:29.619
Do you want to see what
I'll look like when I turn 70?

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:32.619
Turn 70? I can't believe it.

00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:36.299
Look here.

00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:38.859
(See what you look like
when you're old.)

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.018
Two old ladies.

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:42.939

Okay.

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:00.338
Be careful.

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:51.618
to bring my grandma to Jingzhou.

00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:55.098
But she doesn't want to.

00:10:57.779 --> 00:10:58.618

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:09.779
you two are the same,

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:12.539
afraid of troubling your children.

00:11:20.338 --> 00:11:21.659

what should you do?

00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:27.259
Eat well every day
and take your medicine on time.

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:31.498
When the weather is nice,
go out, take a walk and do exercise.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.539
Keep your body healthy and strong.

00:11:34.338 --> 00:11:34.858
This way,

00:11:34.858 --> 00:11:36.659
we can be together for a long time.

00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:41.578

00:11:43.858 --> 00:11:44.738

Okay.

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:06.858
I'll wash my hands first
and then help you wash your hair.

00:12:07.698 --> 00:12:08.259
Wait a moment.

00:12:17.698 --> 00:12:19.218
Let's go.

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:22.419
One, two, three.

00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:23.939
Let's go.

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:27.698
Why are you so late?

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:30.019
It took a while.

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:32.379
I'll be quicker next time.
Let me wash your hair.

00:12:33.698 --> 00:12:34.978
You lost weight.

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:39.218
Are you too tired?

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:40.779
No.

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:43.179
It's all my fault.

00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:45.338
I troubled you, my dear daughter.

00:12:47.698 --> 00:12:48.779
Come here.

00:13:08.498 --> 00:13:09.818
I made this for you.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:12.299
Your favorite vegetable balls.

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:17.978
Remember to take them with you later.

00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:27.698
Remember to heat them up before eating.

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:31.098
It's not good for your stomach
to eat cold food.

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:38.618
Take good care of yourself.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.578
Then I'll be at ease.

00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:51.539
I know.

00:13:53.698 --> 00:13:54.779
I know.

00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:57.539
I'll heat them up before I eat.

00:13:58.659 --> 00:13:59.498
Don't worry.

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:01.338
Mom.

00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:29.899
Six, seven, open your arms.

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:31.899
Eight, good.

00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:33.218
Two.

00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:35.779
Two.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:40.299
Miss Xu has been here for over a week.
She keeps Madam Yu company every day.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:41.299
Seven.

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:43.259
Eight.

00:14:44.019 --> 00:14:45.419
Relax.

00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:48.899
Feels good, right?

00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:50.458
That's it for today.

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:51.939
Let's have breakfast.

00:14:51.939 --> 00:14:53.139
Okay, Xu Yan.

00:14:57.899 --> 00:14:59.019
What did you just call me?

00:15:00.578 --> 00:15:01.698
I called you Xu Yan.

00:15:03.338 --> 00:15:04.818
You remember my name?

00:15:05.618 --> 00:15:07.539
I've always remembered your name.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:09.779
You've always remembered my name?

00:15:09.978 --> 00:15:11.659
What else do you remember?

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:14.299
I also remember

00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:15.498
the delicious osmanthus cake.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.139
Cake.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.858
You helped me catch the thief.

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:18.578
Catch the thief.

00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:20.659
And you took photos with me.

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.458
You're so great! Let me hug you.

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:25.738
Come on.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:26.779
You can't.

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:27.379
One more hug.

00:15:27.698 --> 00:15:28.738
Be careful. Don't move.

00:15:48.858 --> 00:15:51.539
Mr. Shen, you're a winner in life.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:55.259
You're great at golf
and have a successful career.

00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:57.738
And you married a good wife,

00:15:58.098 --> 00:15:59.659
who's been helping you all along.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:00.578
Helping me?

00:16:01.698 --> 00:16:03.698
Mr. Huang, I don't quite understand.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:07.698
Wasn't it you who asked your wife
to take care of my mother-in-law?

00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:09.899
Recently,

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:12.578
Xu Yan has been
taking care of my mother-in-law.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.498
My mother-in-law's condition
has improved.

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.779
Her state is much better than before.

00:16:19.059 --> 00:16:20.858
Didn't you know?

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:23.299
She never told me.

00:16:26.858 --> 00:16:28.738
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:29.818
Anyway,

00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:32.738
please be sure to convey my gratitude
to your wife.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:33.978
Sure, no problem.

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:36.578
But I invited you today

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.059
just to thank your wife.

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:42.698
So today we're just playing golf,
without talking about the work.

00:16:44.818 --> 00:16:47.818
Actually, you take the time
to play golf with me,

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:49.098
which is already my honor.

00:16:50.098 --> 00:16:51.098
After all, you must be

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:53.059
stressed about your group's issues.

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:55.978
It's good to come out
and play golf to relax.

00:16:57.539 --> 00:16:58.779
I'm not stressed at all.

00:17:00.098 --> 00:17:01.458
Shouke is well-funded,

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:04.899
but its structure isn't mature enough.

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:09.018
It is lacking professional talent
and human resources.

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:11.819
Even if you acquire Plot 178,

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:13.498
you can't develop it.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.659
Isn't that something
you should worry about?

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:17.819
Young man,

00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:19.379
you're quite bold.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:21.579
Understaffing and staying

00:17:22.018 --> 00:17:23.099
outside the core circle

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.698
of the real estate industry.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.498
These two have been Shouke's concerns

00:17:27.698 --> 00:17:29.018
and stumbling blocks.

00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:32.458
You want to tackle these issues, right?

00:17:33.939 --> 00:17:35.139
So, Mr. Shen,

00:17:36.058 --> 00:17:38.379
do you have any suggestions?

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:42.018
Shifeng and Mingyuan Group

00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:45.058
are currently

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:47.218
in a fierce contention.

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:50.139
If Shouke now

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:52.018
works with Shifeng,

00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:54.859
it will be a win-win cooperation.

00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:57.258
Mingyuan is bound to lose.

00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:00.218
Shouke has the land

00:18:00.738 --> 00:18:02.298
and can use Shifeng

00:18:03.018 --> 00:18:04.778
to upgrade its entire structure.

00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:08.458
In the future,
your company is sure to stand out.

00:18:09.139 --> 00:18:11.139
It will secure entry to the core circle.

00:18:14.939 --> 00:18:16.899
Let's have a meal together
after the game,

00:18:17.099 --> 00:18:17.939
and we'll discuss it.

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:29.778
That's ridiculous.
Isn't she afraid of being found out?

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:30.379
Yeah.

00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:33.899
- What are you looking at?
- Siwei.

00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:36.339
Look at this news. We're all shocked.

00:18:36.778 --> 00:18:39.939
There's an incredible woman
hiding her true family background.

00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:42.018
(A Wedding Scam behind Large Dowries)
She held weddings with three men

00:18:42.218 --> 00:18:44.659
and obtained huge dowries
and properties from them.

00:18:44.738 --> 00:18:47.379
Moreover, more than 100 guests
attending the wedding invited by her

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.819
were all hired actors.

00:18:49.058 --> 00:18:50.458
Luckily, the truth came out,

00:18:50.698 --> 00:18:52.099
and the groom called the police.

00:18:53.179 --> 00:18:54.778
That's outrageous. Let me see.

00:18:56.058 --> 00:18:57.099
That's ridiculous.

00:18:57.419 --> 00:18:59.099
She isn't afraid of being found out.

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:00.579
Yeah.

00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:02.139
It's so dramatic.

00:19:02.379 --> 00:19:03.218
Right.

00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:04.738
Stop.

00:19:06.218 --> 00:19:07.099
What's wrong?

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:10.498
Nothing.

00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:12.619
This person

00:19:14.498 --> 00:19:16.258
looks so familiar.

00:19:16.538 --> 00:19:17.978
- Familiar? Who is it?
- Who is it?

00:19:18.379 --> 00:19:19.978
When she first came here,

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:23.899
I clearly remember
that she said she only had a grandma.

00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:28.419
When does she have intellectual parents
who live abroad?

00:19:30.458 --> 00:19:32.258
- Send me this link.
- Okay.

00:19:35.058 --> 00:19:36.179
- Sir.
- Come in.

00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:38.579
Sir.

00:19:39.258 --> 00:19:41.819
An interview guest gave me a box of tea.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:43.139
It looked pretty nice.

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:45.218
I haven't had it yet.
I brought it for you.

00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:46.179
What's up?

00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:50.139
Look how observant you are!

00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:50.978
Go ahead.

00:19:52.218 --> 00:19:53.058
Earlier,

00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:56.099
- you went to Xu Yan's wedding, right?
- Yes, I did.

00:19:56.379 --> 00:19:58.859
Did you take photos then?
Could you show them to me?

00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:01.978
Why?

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:05.258
A friend of mine is getting married
next month.

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:07.659
I'd like to watch a high-society wedding

00:20:07.738 --> 00:20:09.298
to see how they set it up.

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:10.179
Well,

00:20:12.258 --> 00:20:13.339
I did take some photos,

00:20:13.698 --> 00:20:16.099
but they were very strict
about this matter.

00:20:16.379 --> 00:20:19.018
Taking photos and sharing
on social media weren't allowed.

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:21.458
I just snuck a few shots.

00:20:22.498 --> 00:20:24.579
Why don't you ask Xu Yan for them?

00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:26.698
Sir, you know very well

00:20:26.738 --> 00:20:28.339
I'm not on good terms with Xu Yan.

00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:35.258
Alright then.

00:20:36.058 --> 00:20:37.018
You watch photos here.

00:20:37.738 --> 00:20:39.698
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:42.579
- Thanks.
- You watch right here.

00:20:42.899 --> 00:20:43.458
Okay.

00:20:43.498 --> 00:20:44.899
I'll taste your tea leaves.

00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:56.058
The high-society wedding
is indeed different.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:57.619
That cost a lot of money.

00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:00.698
But a wealthy family can afford it.

00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:02.538
It's really nice.

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:05.018
Speaking of their wedding,

00:21:05.538 --> 00:21:07.018
it's truly enviable.

00:21:07.738 --> 00:21:09.058
It's high-end and impressive.

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.698
I have to take a good look
for reference.

00:21:13.018 --> 00:21:15.759
I'm telling you, learn a thing or two.

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.859
When you get married,
you hold a better wedding.

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:18.498
Sure.

00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:21.778
Sir, you got the beauty filter on!

00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:24.458
To reduce wrinkles on my face.

00:21:25.538 --> 00:21:26.778
Alright, I'm done.

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:27.899
Well, I have to go.

00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:31.018
- Okay.
- When you run out, I'll get you more.

00:21:31.058 --> 00:21:32.619
Alright, this smells nice.

00:22:07.819 --> 00:22:09.258
Look, it's right here.

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:10.859
No. 16 Yunshui Street.

00:22:11.698 --> 00:22:13.698
Are you sure?
We've gone around several times.

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:14.778
I'm sure.

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:18.698
I've been a paparazzo for three years.
Finding people is my specialty.

00:22:21.738 --> 00:22:22.978
Look, isn't that him?

00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:26.179
Look, it's him, right?

00:22:27.778 --> 00:22:28.619
Xu Yan's father.

00:22:33.659 --> 00:22:34.218
Hello.

00:22:40.218 --> 00:22:41.058
Miss,

00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:43.819
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

00:22:44.579 --> 00:22:46.379
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

00:22:47.058 --> 00:22:48.498
Don't believe me? Check my ID.

00:22:50.379 --> 00:22:50.859
Here.

00:22:52.258 --> 00:22:54.298
My surname isn't Xu. It's Gao.

00:22:55.018 --> 00:22:56.058
Gao Liangjie,

00:22:56.179 --> 00:22:57.538
meaning unwavering integrity.

00:22:57.698 --> 00:22:58.819
Don't panic.

00:22:59.339 --> 00:23:00.899
You don't need to admit anything now.

00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:02.778
Since we could find you,

00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:04.498
it definitely wasn't without reason.

00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:06.058
Let's cooperate.

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:20.939
Xu Yan.

00:23:25.899 --> 00:23:27.819
The finance department needs a host.

00:23:28.379 --> 00:23:31.379
The leadership plans
to select from young hosts.

00:23:31.698 --> 00:23:32.659
I heard you signed up.

00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:36.139
Are you also interested?

00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:38.619
Of course.

00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:41.339
Who would miss
such a good opportunity to pivot?

00:23:45.978 --> 00:23:48.819
But I don't plan to read the script
they've prepared for me.

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:52.978
I want to use the news
I've personally gathered and edited

00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:54.018
to make a demo.

00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:00.058
We're drowning in information.

00:24:00.738 --> 00:24:02.538
Separating fact from fiction

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:04.498
and giving the public truth,
genuine insight,

00:24:04.538 --> 00:24:05.899
and sincere affection

00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:07.579
is what truly matters.

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:10.899
I can see you've been working hard.

00:24:12.058 --> 00:24:13.538
Your thinking seems beyond you.

00:24:16.978 --> 00:24:17.899
Rest assured.

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:21.179
My demo is absolutely genuine

00:24:21.698 --> 00:24:23.058
and impactful enough.

00:24:24.139 --> 00:24:26.619
It will definitely be unforgettable.

00:24:30.018 --> 00:24:30.778
Good luck.

00:24:31.058 --> 00:24:31.579
Thank you.

00:24:50.458 --> 00:24:52.419
Please begin
reading the assigned script.

00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:56.016
(News Program Host Selection Contest)

00:24:58.778 --> 00:25:01.498
Recently, a cold wave
named Niuniu Niuniu Six

00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:03.379
came from the Scandinavian Peninsula.

00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:06.819
It will pass
through Norin-Sebestei-Bvlag,

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.899
Barunbagabayanner,

00:25:09.018 --> 00:25:11.579
Tuiraomuyin, and Ulantaolegai,
and so on.

00:25:11.738 --> 00:25:14.099
Please use simple terms
to tell the audience

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.258
about the meanings
of physical settlement,

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:18.899
cash settlement, and leverage
in futures.

00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:21.738
You book a bag.

00:25:22.498 --> 00:25:23.978
The sales tells you it's arrived.

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:25.978
You buy it and then resell it.

00:25:26.139 --> 00:25:30.058
That's called physical settlement.

00:25:30.058 --> 00:25:33.458
You find that the spot price
is way higher than the price you booked.

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:36.978
So you plan to sell the booked bag
directly to your peers.

00:25:37.139 --> 00:25:40.419
That's called cash settlement.

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:43.339
You decided to use 100 yuan
to buy the bag

00:25:43.538 --> 00:25:45.939
and resell it to your peers
to earn a 10 yuan spread.

00:25:46.139 --> 00:25:48.419
But in the end,
you only spent 10 yuan on a deposit

00:25:48.498 --> 00:25:51.179
and directly sold the bag to your peers,
earning a 10 yuan spread.

00:25:51.498 --> 00:25:54.258
That's called leverage.

00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:55.538
As a host,

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:58.218
do you think it's more important
to speak logically

00:25:58.298 --> 00:25:59.298
or to speak with facts?

00:26:07.458 --> 00:26:11.218
News has been defined
as the first draft of history.

00:26:11.778 --> 00:26:13.538
So in this draft,

00:26:14.018 --> 00:26:14.978
the factual part

00:26:15.018 --> 00:26:17.379
can be handled by reporters and others.

00:26:17.698 --> 00:26:18.698
But the logical part

00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:20.859
is to be elevated by the host.

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:22.419
Everyone saw it, right?

00:26:22.498 --> 00:26:23.939
Yan was overwhelming.

00:26:24.058 --> 00:26:25.978
She amazed the judges in three rounds.

00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:27.339
When Yan hosts,

00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:28.778
she's always confident,

00:26:28.819 --> 00:26:30.218
poised, and natural.

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:31.579
What's most important?

00:26:31.978 --> 00:26:33.419
The audience likes her.

00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:36.579
The results aren't out yet.
Let's not say anything.

00:26:36.939 --> 00:26:39.698
If you go on, I'll be so embarrassed.

00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:42.179
Yan, you'll definitely make it.

00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:46.698
- Treat us!
- Treat us!

00:26:46.778 --> 00:26:49.659
Alright, tonight's dinner is on me.

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:52.099
Order whatever you like, okay?

00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:55.179
- Go back to work.
- Work.

00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:55.659
Hurry up.

00:26:55.698 --> 00:26:56.379
Back to work.

00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:00.899
By the way, Yu, fix the thing
we discussed earlier.

00:27:02.218 --> 00:27:02.738
Xu Yan.

00:27:04.179 --> 00:27:04.698
Xu Yan.

00:27:06.218 --> 00:27:07.099
Here you are.

00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:10.698
What's up?

00:27:13.379 --> 00:27:14.819
Didn't I tell you

00:27:15.339 --> 00:27:16.978
that I want to make a news demo?

00:27:17.498 --> 00:27:18.538
It's really unfortunate.

00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:20.018
My guest is stuck in traffic.

00:27:20.058 --> 00:27:21.258
He needs another hour.

00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:22.939
Can you be my guest?

00:27:23.258 --> 00:27:24.379
Please, help me out.

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:30.018
Yan, the editing room is waiting
for you to review the footage.

00:27:35.498 --> 00:27:38.498
I didn't know about your interview
or have background research.

00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:40.778
How can I be your guest?

00:27:42.058 --> 00:27:43.899
It's just some simple Q&A.

00:27:44.058 --> 00:27:45.099
Plus, it's pre-recorded.

00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:46.659
We can stop when there's a mistake.

00:27:46.738 --> 00:27:47.419
Right, sir?

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:50.058
Miss Xu.

00:27:50.698 --> 00:27:52.579
Miss Sun asked everyone,
and no one is available.

00:27:53.018 --> 00:27:53.498
Sir...

00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:54.778
I'll go to the editing room.

00:27:55.659 --> 00:27:56.339
You help her.

00:28:02.698 --> 00:28:03.179
Okay.

00:28:03.698 --> 00:28:05.579
Xu Yan, thank you so much.

00:28:05.619 --> 00:28:06.778
I'm counting on you fully.

00:28:14.698 --> 00:28:16.939
(Talk to Weiwei)
I'm honored to have my great partner,

00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:19.899
Ms. Xu Yan, the main planner
of Family Feast,

00:28:20.058 --> 00:28:22.419
to discuss
hot social issues with us here.

00:28:27.778 --> 00:28:30.018
Recently, I came across a news report.

00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:32.698
(A Wedding Scam behind Large Dowries)
A married woman hid her marital history

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:35.619
and hired people to impersonate
family and friends to hold a wedding,

00:28:35.659 --> 00:28:38.859
aiming at swindling the man
out of a huge dowry.

00:28:50.819 --> 00:28:53.379
Mr. Gao, the extra in this news story,

00:28:53.379 --> 00:28:54.419
is also here with us.

00:28:54.538 --> 00:28:55.339
Let's welcome him.

00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:59.179
(The worst-case scenario just happened.)

00:28:59.899 --> 00:29:02.859
(I know I'm standing
on the edge of a cliff right now.)

00:29:09.058 --> 00:29:10.738
- Hello, Mr. Gao.
- Hello, Miss Sun.

00:29:11.698 --> 00:29:14.258
Miss Xu, what a coincidence
to see you here.

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:17.738
Mr. Gao, do you know Xu Yan?

00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:19.419
We know each other well.

00:29:20.698 --> 00:29:21.978
Where did you two meet?

00:29:22.899 --> 00:29:24.538
I... I don't really remember.

00:29:25.738 --> 00:29:26.939
I don't know where.

00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:28.778
You...

00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:30.339
Look at her.

00:29:30.738 --> 00:29:31.339
It's okay.

00:29:31.538 --> 00:29:32.538
Let's sit down and talk.

00:29:32.698 --> 00:29:33.419
Alright.

00:29:42.339 --> 00:29:42.939
Mr. Gao,

00:29:43.258 --> 00:29:44.859
may I ask what the reason was

00:29:44.859 --> 00:29:47.339
that made you impersonate
a wedding guest?

00:29:49.778 --> 00:29:52.619
Actually, many people
sought me out before.

00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:56.218
Some did so
because their families lack members.

00:29:56.659 --> 00:29:58.379
They wanted me to liven things up.

00:29:58.698 --> 00:30:00.899
Others did it purely for appearances.

00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:04.379
They were afraid
the event wouldn't measure up

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:05.339
to the in-laws.

00:30:06.298 --> 00:30:08.258
Were there any cases
of marriage fraud among them?

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:15.298
Yes, there were.

00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:22.419
Mr. Gao, this could be seen as fraud.

00:30:22.538 --> 00:30:25.018
Once exposed,
you might face criminal charges.

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:28.099
It was always the bride
committing fraud.

00:30:28.698 --> 00:30:30.899
I only found out afterwards.

00:30:31.139 --> 00:30:33.258
I really regretted it.

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:34.619
I really did.

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:36.859
I shouldn't have gone along with them.

00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:40.579
We can see that Mr. Gao
has reflected deeply.

00:30:40.659 --> 00:30:42.538
It's alright.
We learn from our mistakes.

00:30:43.298 --> 00:30:45.139
As law-abiding citizens,

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:47.018
- we must follow the law.
- Yes.

00:30:47.058 --> 00:30:49.450
- We must not go down the wrong path.
- Yes.

00:30:54.288 --> 00:30:56.976
Mr. Gao, the person
in the photo is you, right?

00:30:57.468 --> 00:30:58.738
Yes, that's me.

00:30:59.978 --> 00:31:02.619
What role did you play at the wedding?

00:31:03.579 --> 00:31:04.339
The bride's father.

00:31:05.018 --> 00:31:06.458
It's a double fate.

00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:07.419
Double fate.

00:31:20.458 --> 00:31:21.659
Isn't this Ms. Xu's wedding?

00:31:21.978 --> 00:31:23.179
What's going on?

00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:24.819
Was he at her wedding ceremony?

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:27.058
I must say, they do look alike.

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:34.298
Mr. Gao,

00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:37.018
what about this photo?

00:31:46.939 --> 00:31:47.458
Well...

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:48.458
What do you mean?

00:31:51.018 --> 00:31:55.819
I discovered by chance
while investigating this news story

00:31:55.899 --> 00:32:00.258
that Mr. Gao and Xu Yan's father
might be the same person.

00:32:00.778 --> 00:32:03.538
As journalists,
we need to get to the bottom of things

00:32:03.579 --> 00:32:04.939
and pursue the truth.

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:06.218
Mr. Gao,

00:32:06.698 --> 00:32:09.538
you seem to have known Miss Xu
for a long time.

00:32:10.179 --> 00:32:11.738
What's your relationship?

00:32:11.859 --> 00:32:14.339
Is the person in the photo actually you?

00:32:14.379 --> 00:32:16.859
Are you Xu Yan's fake father?

00:32:16.859 --> 00:32:18.099
Please answer directly.

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:19.379
Sun Siwei,

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:22.458
you've gone too far.

00:32:24.298 --> 00:32:26.899
I didn't expect you
to be this unreasonable.

00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:30.099
Does anyone here not know
that we have a bad relationship?

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:31.819
You've always belittled me.

00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:33.458
You coveted my guests,

00:32:33.579 --> 00:32:34.498
broadcast slots,

00:32:34.939 --> 00:32:35.978
and makeup artists.

00:32:36.139 --> 00:32:37.419
I can put up with all of that.

00:32:38.018 --> 00:32:38.819
But what's this?

00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:40.458
What do you want to do?

00:32:40.538 --> 00:32:41.698
You're being ridiculous.

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.498
Xu Yan, you're stopping Mr. Gao

00:32:43.498 --> 00:32:44.218
from talking.

00:32:44.218 --> 00:32:45.498
Are you hiding something?

00:32:45.819 --> 00:32:46.419
Mr. Gao,

00:32:46.978 --> 00:32:48.698
there are many people
in the studio today.

00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:50.819
Everyone present can witness this.

00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:53.579
You don't need to be afraid.
No one can do anything to you.

00:32:54.258 --> 00:32:56.579
You just need to tell me clearly.

00:32:56.819 --> 00:32:59.458
Is the person in the photo you?

00:32:59.458 --> 00:33:02.139
Did you pretend to be Xu Yan's father?

00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:24.859
No, that person is not me.

00:33:27.058 --> 00:33:28.258
He looks a lot like him.

00:33:30.218 --> 00:33:31.058
Aren't they the same?

00:33:31.058 --> 00:33:32.139
Is he serious?

00:33:37.339 --> 00:33:38.978
Look carefully before you speak.

00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:40.859
I have looked carefully.

00:33:41.538 --> 00:33:43.738
I can't possibly not recognize myself.

00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:50.579
This photo is quite clear.

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:52.899
The facial features
are from the same person.

00:33:53.258 --> 00:33:55.379
If you say it's not you, tell me,

00:33:55.379 --> 00:33:57.258
what were you doing
on September 20th this year?

00:33:57.258 --> 00:33:59.018
Did you go to Xu Yan's wedding?

00:33:59.738 --> 00:34:01.218
Miss Sun.

00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:04.939
I admit that I'm in that photo.

00:34:05.379 --> 00:34:07.218
But I'm not in this photo.

00:34:07.538 --> 00:34:09.339
If I had such an aura and demeanor,

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:11.018
would I still be doing this job?

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:14.498
Yes, this gentleman
may look a bit like me.

00:34:14.779 --> 00:34:17.178
But in this world,
let alone just looking alike,

00:34:17.299 --> 00:34:19.299
there are even people
who look exactly the same.

00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:21.978
Even their own parents
might not recognize them, right?

00:34:23.178 --> 00:34:24.939
How do you explain
knowing each other before?

00:34:25.018 --> 00:34:26.178
How did you know each other?

00:34:27.138 --> 00:34:29.138
Well, that's a long story.

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:33.819
Once, the Family Feast show
recruited off-site guests.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.178
And I signed up.

00:34:35.498 --> 00:34:38.578
It happened to be Miss Xu
who received us.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:41.219
Let me tell you,
Miss Xu was very enthusiastic.

00:34:41.458 --> 00:34:43.058
She looked after our meals every day.

00:34:43.178 --> 00:34:45.098
In the evening,
she even helped us go over...

00:34:45.138 --> 00:34:45.819
What's it again?

00:34:45.939 --> 00:34:47.018
You're talking nonsense!

00:34:48.138 --> 00:34:49.658
Stop the machines. Stop the recording.

00:34:49.978 --> 00:34:51.379
Has Ms. Sun gone crazy?

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:53.058
This is clearly framing.

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:54.739
Sun Siwei,

00:34:55.538 --> 00:34:56.899
I'll show you more evidence.

00:34:58.058 --> 00:34:59.299
Huanhuan, give me the phone.

00:35:02.299 --> 00:35:05.618
Mr. Gao, you have
a birthmark here, right?

00:35:05.739 --> 00:35:06.259
Yes.

00:35:06.739 --> 00:35:07.699
I have a birthmark here.

00:35:07.978 --> 00:35:09.299
Look, here it is.

00:35:09.779 --> 00:35:11.219
Look here.

00:35:16.178 --> 00:35:17.379
Put it onto the big screen.

00:35:17.578 --> 00:35:18.018
Okay.

00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:20.739
I'm sorry about today.

00:35:20.779 --> 00:35:21.978
It's alright.

00:35:23.458 --> 00:35:24.419
I told the truth.

00:35:29.578 --> 00:35:30.538
Is this by script?

00:35:31.018 --> 00:35:32.058
I think so.

00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:33.498
Is it real or not?

00:35:36.498 --> 00:35:38.739
All these materials given need to be...

00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:41.538
I'm sorry.

00:35:42.578 --> 00:35:44.538
What's this here?

00:35:46.618 --> 00:35:48.259
A birthmark.
I've had it since childhood.

00:35:49.098 --> 00:35:51.339
It must be covered starting tomorrow.

00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:52.458
No problem.

00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:53.859
My father has no birthmarks.

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:56.899
Do you believe it now?

00:36:09.939 --> 00:36:11.259
You colluded, right?

00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:13.739
Setting me up, huh?

00:36:20.498 --> 00:36:21.739
I advise you to calm down.

00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:40.259
Don't worry.

00:36:40.379 --> 00:36:43.138
My demo is absolutely genuine

00:36:43.259 --> 00:36:44.458
and impactful enough.

00:36:44.578 --> 00:36:47.018
It will definitely be unforgettable.

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:48.578
Good luck.

00:36:48.859 --> 00:36:49.458
Thank you.

00:37:03.339 --> 00:37:04.018
Where are you?

00:37:05.498 --> 00:37:06.098
Let's meet.

00:37:07.018 --> 00:37:07.859
I understand.

00:37:08.178 --> 00:37:09.739
Miss Xu, please rest assured.

00:37:10.018 --> 00:37:11.739
I will never betray you.

00:37:21.058 --> 00:37:22.458
What do you mean, Sir?

00:37:22.498 --> 00:37:24.498
Why must I take a break for a while?

00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:26.578
Pause your work.

00:37:27.259 --> 00:37:28.419
Is it clear enough now?

00:37:29.018 --> 00:37:31.259
Your demo from last time's evaluation

00:37:31.899 --> 00:37:33.058
made such a big fuss.

00:37:34.458 --> 00:37:36.578
The most infuriating thing
is that you lied to me.

00:37:37.178 --> 00:37:38.138
You stole my photo.

00:37:39.498 --> 00:37:40.939
It's lucky you haven't been fired.

00:37:41.658 --> 00:37:42.739
Don't push it.

00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:45.058
I was tricked too.

00:37:55.219 --> 00:37:57.098
Mom, Xu Yan is bullying me a lot.

00:37:57.219 --> 00:37:58.219
What happened this time?

00:37:58.899 --> 00:37:59.939
She's picking on me.

00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:00.859
You have to help me.

00:38:00.939 --> 00:38:02.458
How can I help with your work issues?

00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:03.578
Handle it yourself.

00:38:04.138 --> 00:38:04.899
I don't care.

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:17.379
Sun Siwei,

00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:21.138
you're trying too hard to take me down.

00:38:22.178 --> 00:38:23.578
When you try too hard,

00:38:24.699 --> 00:38:25.899
it becomes ugly.

00:38:29.178 --> 00:38:30.739
Don't think because you married well,

00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:32.978
you're actually someone important.

00:38:33.259 --> 00:38:35.219
You're not fit to shine my shoes.

00:38:36.739 --> 00:38:39.058
Your little tricks
that can't be presented

00:38:39.259 --> 00:38:41.098
can fool others but not me.

00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:43.018
You're just a liar.

00:39:01.419 --> 00:39:02.458
Yes, I'm a liar.

00:39:05.618 --> 00:39:06.739
Even if I'm a liar,

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:08.219
I still have the ability

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:10.458
to turn you into a dog
begging me for food.

00:39:20.299 --> 00:39:20.899
Yan!

00:39:23.058 --> 00:39:23.658
Are you okay?

00:39:29.538 --> 00:39:30.618
What's with that acting?

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:35.339
Are you Sun Siwei?

00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:36.496
I am.

00:39:44.779 --> 00:39:46.658
Chen Lin, inform the Legal Department

00:39:47.339 --> 00:39:48.779
to drop everything they're doing

00:39:48.939 --> 00:39:50.178
and gather in the meeting room.

00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:54.458
My wife is bullied at work. Let them
have a plan to hold her accountable.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:55.498
She's Sun Siwei.

00:39:59.018 --> 00:39:59.498
Let's go.

00:40:13.058 --> 00:40:14.299
All departments, get ready.

00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:15.098
Host, get ready.

00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:16.138
Counting down.

00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:16.978
Five.

00:40:17.379 --> 00:40:17.978
Four.

00:40:18.339 --> 00:40:18.899
Three.

00:40:19.339 --> 00:40:19.899
Two.

00:40:20.498 --> 00:40:21.098
One.

00:40:21.379 --> 00:40:23.058
