WEBVTT

00:00:01.352 --> 00:00:02.622
I have some conditions.

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:04.022
Three, to be exact.

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:06.384
If you accept my conditions...

00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:09.554
and we get them notarized, then we have a deal.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:12.394
Notarized?

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:13.794
First.

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:16.794
The partnership will be a trial of three months.

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:18.264
Second.

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:21.264
If the partnership dissolves after three months,

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:23.904
Mamdaerozip will get its own office and move out.

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:25.504
Third.

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:28.374
Our relationship will be strictly professional.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.104
If you can agree to those three conditions,

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:33.144
I will partner with you.

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:37.844
What do you mean by "strictly professional?"

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:41.584
You'll be CEO Lee, and I'll be Manager Ji.

00:00:58.034 --> 00:00:59.134
Do you need...

00:01:00.034 --> 00:01:01.134
some time to think about it?

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:04.604
And "if the partnership dissolves?"

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:08.214
Because our feelings could change at any time.

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:09.684
Both of us.

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:15.254
So that's how you want to do this.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:16.954
With your three conditions.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.554
Yes.

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:24.124
And what about the partnership terms I proposed?

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:25.764
About that...

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:29.204
Let's discuss it after this is notarized.

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:32.974
So you want to get this notarized first.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.904
I can't have you backing out of this once the main contract is signed.

00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:49.584
So, think it over.

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:53.824
I'll draft the notarization papers. You can go to the site.

00:01:56.264 --> 00:01:58.964
I should draft the contract too. It'll save time.

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.074
- Okay. - I'll get going, then.

00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:23.654
"Strictly professional," really?

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.594
And if the partnership ends, she wants me gone.

00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:30.664
You really play hardball, Ji Eun Oh.

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:36.364
I did the right thing.

00:02:36.704 --> 00:02:37.964
This is how it has to be.

00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:42.244
(Message)

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:44.304
Did you pull an all-nighter at the cafe?

00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:46.974
I think I just saw you.

00:02:48.214 --> 00:02:49.214
What?

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.314
I'm surprised you saw me at this hour, Mr. Park.

00:02:56.254 --> 00:02:59.024
What, you haven't heard? I've been working very hard lately.

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:06.634
So, did you pull an all-nighter?

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:07.964
(Eun Oh)

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:11.734
I'll explain later.

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:27.884
Whether I'm a snake or a fox, who cares?

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.184
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk,

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:32.254
and I'm just going to be me.

00:03:35.124 --> 00:03:36.224
Ji Eun Oh.

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:39.994
(Jo Gyeong Su)

00:03:43.064 --> 00:03:45.704
Hey, Gyeong Su. It's me, Ji Hyuk.

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:47.234
Is it too early to call?

00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:48.674
This is my new number.

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:51.044
Hey, what a surprise. I wasn't expecting your call.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:54.314
Hey, I heard you were back and starting up Mamdaerozip.

00:03:55.044 --> 00:03:56.284
How have you been?

00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:58.484
Oh, so you heard about my situation.

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:02.354
I'm barely making enough to pay rent and put food on the table at home.

00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:05.354
I'm doing well enough to eat out whenever I want.

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.494
What do you mean?

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:09.994
- Are you trying to recruit me? - Are you interested in teaming up?

00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:16.534
We're collecting new design ideas,

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:18.904
and we'll finalize the renewal lineup next week.

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:19.974
Right.

00:04:20.234 --> 00:04:22.404
During the initial review of the design ideas,

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:24.444
let's make sure they align with our brand's tone.

00:04:24.704 --> 00:04:25.714
Understood.

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:28.374
We need a dedicated design line for the overseas market.

00:04:32.754 --> 00:04:36.284
You mean, create separate designs for overseas markets, Director Park?

00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:39.724
That's correct. Each continent likes its own styles.

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:43.694
We should maintain the functionality but differentiate the styles.

00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:51.204
But our policy is to maintain our core identity.

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:54.634
But I don't believe that means we should be resistant to change.

00:04:54.774 --> 00:04:58.374
Our company goes back decades, to the last chairman's generation.

00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:02.544
But what we need to focus on now is the future of Shoe Joy.

00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:03.814
(Shoe Joy, Shoealls)

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:05.044
He has a point.

00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:08.784
Director Park, I trust you have data to back this proposal?

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.684
Of course.

00:05:13.224 --> 00:05:14.424
Anything else?

00:05:17.524 --> 00:05:19.364
I would like to present a proposal to the Management Team.

00:05:20.364 --> 00:05:23.634
I visited several of our franchises and asked for a shoe recommendation.

00:05:24.534 --> 00:05:26.504
They all just recommended the bestseller.

00:05:27.034 --> 00:05:28.034
Instead of that,

00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:30.804
what outfits I'd be wearing them with,

00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:32.674
what colours I usually wear,

00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:35.414
or if they're for me or a gift for my parents,

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:37.044
what my personal style is like...

00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:40.784
If they ask these questions first and then make a recommendation,

00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:43.124
I think we'd be far more likely to make a sale.

00:05:44.524 --> 00:05:48.194
Actually, our franchise manual was written years ago.

00:05:48.694 --> 00:05:50.194
Right, yes.

00:05:51.064 --> 00:05:53.194
Director Park, review the manual.

00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:55.864
- Yes, sir. - Good.

00:05:57.664 --> 00:05:58.874
All right, what's next?

00:06:00.274 --> 00:06:01.834
All right, that's all for today.

00:06:02.304 --> 00:06:03.504
Good work, everyone.

00:06:14.854 --> 00:06:18.284
They say all roads lead to Rome. Took you long enough to get here.

00:06:20.454 --> 00:06:21.454
Pardon?

00:06:22.054 --> 00:06:23.724
You weren't half bad today.

00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:27.464
Now, you're finally acting like my son.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.104
That's my boy.

00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:44.944
Oh, this is Manager Kang's desk.

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:49.184
Yes, she got married. So I've taken over for her.

00:06:49.354 --> 00:06:51.484
But the text I received came from Manager Kang.

00:06:51.554 --> 00:06:53.754
It's her old work phone. Please, have a seat.

00:07:02.334 --> 00:07:05.364
- Is this him? - My gosh. No.

00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:11.104
You must be Su Bin. You'll be meeting this man here.

00:07:11.774 --> 00:07:14.614
Not him. I want the other guy, the one I just saw.

00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:17.144
He's totally my type.

00:07:17.484 --> 00:07:18.684
I'm afraid that's not possible.

00:07:21.414 --> 00:07:25.254
His minimum requirement is a woman with a full-time, stable job.

00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:26.354
A full-time job?

00:07:26.394 --> 00:07:30.524
He says it's the minimum proof of a diligent and responsible life.

00:07:31.364 --> 00:07:34.864
Nowadays, everyone wants to be a video creator.

00:07:35.194 --> 00:07:37.464
"I'll quit my job to be a video creator."

00:07:37.464 --> 00:07:39.434
"Should I quit my job and start a travel channel?"

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:42.744
"I should start my own channel too." It's the world we live in, isn't it?

00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:45.004
I didn't even ask his qualifications.

00:07:45.004 --> 00:07:47.344
I'm taking a shot based on his vibe.

00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:51.744
Do you think he'd change his mind once he actually meets me?

00:07:52.114 --> 00:07:55.684
Then why would he have signed up for an agency in the first place?

00:07:56.824 --> 00:08:01.494
This is a matchmaking agency. These days, the more a man has,

00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:03.464
the more they want a woman on their level.

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.964
It's just human nature, isn't it?

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:12.434
The text mentioned two candidates. Who's the other one?

00:08:13.974 --> 00:08:18.104
The CEO of a small firm in his mid-30s. Height, 178cm.

00:08:18.244 --> 00:08:20.744
Oh, and both of his parents are pharmacists.

00:08:21.644 --> 00:08:23.084
And he's handsome, right?

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:27.714
So what's the catch?

00:08:28.014 --> 00:08:29.024
Excuse me?

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:32.724
He can't check every single box. So there must be a catch.

00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:36.224
Yes, there is one small drawback.

00:08:38.024 --> 00:08:39.634
He's divorced.

00:08:40.094 --> 00:08:41.334
With one son.

00:08:42.464 --> 00:08:43.664
What did you just say?

00:08:44.764 --> 00:08:47.804
- Hello? - Oh, hello.

00:08:49.374 --> 00:08:51.404
What are you doing here? You didn't even call.

00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:53.214
Is something wrong?

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:56.514
We're going into business together now.

00:08:57.014 --> 00:08:59.654
Are these the cabinets you mentioned?

00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:01.554
They look even better in person.

00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:04.884
Right? Now that they're installed here,

00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:07.194
they look even more beautiful and high-end.

00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:10.194
And she was a huge help with the colour consultation.

00:09:11.164 --> 00:09:13.764
Ms. Ji has always had a great eye for design.

00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:20.534
Wow, it looks so much cleaner without the molding.

00:09:20.904 --> 00:09:23.704
And this part here came out exactly as I requested.

00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:26.774
They say this part is customizable however you want.

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:31.084
- Right. - Ma'am, can you come here, please?

00:09:31.144 --> 00:09:32.684
Yes, one moment.

00:09:37.754 --> 00:09:41.724
Don't you think it's a little weird to show up at my work unannounced?

00:09:41.794 --> 00:09:44.694
Work on Hyunmyeong Apts began, so I was nearby checking on it...

00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:46.834
and was on my way back from an off-site meeting.

00:09:47.164 --> 00:09:49.064
It's not like I came here to see you.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.604
I'm here on business.

00:09:51.264 --> 00:09:54.534
Plus, I was curious to see how these kitchen cabinets turned out.

00:09:55.774 --> 00:09:58.044
We'll get everything notarized before heading back to the office.

00:09:59.144 --> 00:10:02.584
- Notarized? - I booked a notary for 4:30pm.

00:10:02.984 --> 00:10:06.714
So I could do two things at once. Is that really such a problem?

00:10:07.554 --> 00:10:09.684
Especially since we're about to notarize our partnership.

00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:13.954
You could've at least texted me.

00:10:14.354 --> 00:10:17.024
You think I didn't? I'm not looking for trouble.

00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:22.264
Let's go to the notary's office when you're done here.

00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:28.874
I'm sorry. I didn't hear the text alert.

00:10:30.174 --> 00:10:31.204
Nothing to be sorry about.

00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:34.344
Han Min's mom, right?

00:10:34.644 --> 00:10:37.344
Would it be okay if I took photos of the kitchen?

00:10:37.414 --> 00:10:41.354
Remember I mentioned this? I'd share them in our group chat...

00:10:41.414 --> 00:10:43.454
as a reference for the other residents.

00:10:43.724 --> 00:10:46.154
My gosh, you remember my kid's name?

00:10:46.224 --> 00:10:48.324
Of course. You showed me Han Min's photos.

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:50.394
- How could I forget his name? - Go ahead and take photos.

00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:51.494
Great, thank you.

00:11:25.224 --> 00:11:26.694
What's the rush?

00:11:27.364 --> 00:11:30.134
The notary leaves at 5pm, so we have to get there by 4:45pm.

00:11:30.804 --> 00:11:33.634
That's not what I meant. It doesn't have to be today.

00:11:33.704 --> 00:11:34.734
For me, it has to be done today.

00:11:37.604 --> 00:11:39.374
Because I said I would get it done.

00:11:41.314 --> 00:11:43.014
It was brought up this morning.

00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:45.784
Are you afraid I'll change my mind by tomorrow?

00:11:45.954 --> 00:11:47.914
No, don't be ridiculous.

00:11:48.414 --> 00:11:51.254
Once Ji Eun Oh gives her word, she sticks to it no matter what.

00:11:51.324 --> 00:11:52.894
Who wouldn't know that about you?

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:57.524
Could you also take responsibility for my safety?

00:11:57.664 --> 00:11:58.894
You're making me really nervous.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:02.604
I'm sticking to the speed limit. I'm just weaving past cars...

00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:03.904
going 20 percent slower than the limit.

00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:08.004
Oh, you don't drive, so you have no sense of speed.

00:12:10.004 --> 00:12:11.504
And now, you're back to talking casually again.

00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:14.814
We haven't notarized it yet, and we haven't signed the agreement.

00:12:19.654 --> 00:12:21.784
Then let's go to the notary now. Quickly.

00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:27.354
(Corporate Notarization)

00:12:27.424 --> 00:12:28.794
(August 15, 2025, Ji Eun Oh)

00:12:55.584 --> 00:12:57.224
Now that the notarization is out of the way,

00:12:57.554 --> 00:12:58.654
let's go get something to eat.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.024
Since we got the notarization taken care of,

00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:04.564
Let's keep it professional. Mr. Lee.

00:13:04.964 --> 00:13:06.694
We still haven't signed the partnership agreement.

00:13:07.164 --> 00:13:09.634
You said we should notarize it beforehand, right?

00:13:10.964 --> 00:13:12.464
This is unbelievable.

00:13:13.674 --> 00:13:15.834
If it's all going to be strictly professional after we sign,

00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:18.204
I can still treat you as a junior.

00:13:18.704 --> 00:13:19.714
Right?

00:13:20.314 --> 00:13:22.544
Man, I'm starving. Let's go get some gukbap.

00:13:23.044 --> 00:13:25.814
No, not gukbap. I don't like it.

00:13:26.214 --> 00:13:29.784
What? You don't like gukbap? We used to eat it all the time.

00:13:30.254 --> 00:13:32.054
I never liked it, not once.

00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:34.924
I like tteokbokki. Let's go get some.

00:13:38.994 --> 00:13:40.564
I mean, I could eat it.

00:13:56.984 --> 00:13:58.084
You're really digging in.

00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:03.854
Ji Eun Oh.

00:14:04.324 --> 00:14:05.754
Aren't you a little disappointed?

00:14:06.754 --> 00:14:08.494
That I agreed so easily?

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:11.364
Not at all. Why would I be?

00:14:11.664 --> 00:14:13.664
It's a very typical Lee Ji Hyuk move.

00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:15.594
Business always comes first for you.

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:20.504
Because money is all that matters to me?

00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:22.874
Bingo.

00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.794
Was it because of your family?

00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:51.364
Is that why you agreed to the partnership?

00:14:54.074 --> 00:14:55.234
Gang Oh...

00:14:55.574 --> 00:14:57.444
Did things ever get sorted out with your brother?

00:15:00.514 --> 00:15:02.314
I'd rather not talk about my personal life.

00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:08.714
Okay, we won't.

00:15:27.974 --> 00:15:29.004
How did you two get here together?

00:15:30.504 --> 00:15:31.804
You're here.

00:15:33.874 --> 00:15:35.074
It's kind of a long story.

00:15:36.684 --> 00:15:38.914
- Should we take care of this now? - Yes.

00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:56.504
It's news to me too. I have no idea what's up with those two.

00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:02.374
Yes, come on in.

00:16:08.714 --> 00:16:09.744
Here, have a seat.

00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:12.814
I heard you were getting a new web designer,

00:16:13.454 --> 00:16:15.014
but it looks like everything's already set up.

00:16:15.214 --> 00:16:17.254
I needed a full-stack web developer who could also manage the website.

00:16:17.624 --> 00:16:19.724
(Partnership Agreement)

00:16:21.454 --> 00:16:23.264
You work faster than I thought.

00:16:23.324 --> 00:16:25.064
How well can one person really know another?

00:16:26.024 --> 00:16:28.094
So you had me pegged as the slow type.

00:16:37.044 --> 00:16:38.704
(Article 10: Death, bankruptcy, or other causes)

00:16:40.644 --> 00:16:42.814
I can't accept terms that are so favourable to me.

00:16:44.284 --> 00:16:45.384
Let's make it 50-50.

00:16:45.684 --> 00:16:47.414
For our temporary three-month partnership,

00:16:47.684 --> 00:16:49.624
you need to be compensated for not using Eunoism's name.

00:16:50.284 --> 00:16:51.984
That's why I made the offer, so let's just leave it as is.

00:16:52.654 --> 00:16:55.854
If we continue after three months, we can renegotiate then.

00:16:56.594 --> 00:16:59.564
I'll add that as a special clause and make the change. Okay?

00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:03.334
Okay, fine.

00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:07.204
(Partner A: Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:17:07.274 --> 00:17:08.774
(Partner B: Ji Eun Oh)

00:17:13.374 --> 00:17:16.014
I look forward to working with you, Manager Ji Eun Oh.

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:22.284
I look forward to it too, CEO Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:29.094
After I contact the turnkey clients, I'll give you an update.

00:17:29.594 --> 00:17:31.224
You're free until then.

00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:34.034
Oh, okay.

00:17:34.564 --> 00:17:35.564
Well, I'll be going then.

00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.164
So this is what we've come to.

00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:05.894
Fine.

00:18:06.834 --> 00:18:08.864
I'll be exactly what you want me to be.

00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:12.004
Ji Eun Oh.

00:18:14.334 --> 00:18:16.704
So you're saying you're going into business together?

00:18:17.044 --> 00:18:18.204
With Ji Hyuk?

00:18:19.044 --> 00:18:21.914
Yes, I just came from signing the partnership agreement.

00:18:22.444 --> 00:18:23.484
What? Why?

00:18:23.944 --> 00:18:26.914
Of all people, why would you partner with Ji Hyuk?

00:18:29.054 --> 00:18:30.224
Because I want to make money.

00:18:37.964 --> 00:18:40.164
(Couples' Bar)

00:19:01.714 --> 00:19:03.784
Seriously, Gang Oh? Do you not get it?

00:19:05.424 --> 00:19:08.994
I told you to empty all the trash. Why'd you skip the bathroom one?

00:19:09.424 --> 00:19:11.124
You want me to empty the trash in the women's restroom too?

00:19:11.664 --> 00:19:13.864
You think you're in a position to be picky about it?

00:19:14.994 --> 00:19:16.934
Just empty that into this bag and throw it all out.

00:19:19.634 --> 00:19:20.674
In here?

00:19:21.604 --> 00:19:24.704
Pack it down. There's plenty of room for that and more.

00:19:25.004 --> 00:19:26.514
Hey, are you the one paying for these trash bags?

00:19:27.544 --> 00:19:28.574
Hey, Yang Jin Gu.

00:19:30.244 --> 00:19:31.414
Aren't you going too far?

00:19:31.784 --> 00:19:33.114
What am I, your servant?

00:19:34.854 --> 00:19:36.454
Looks like you'll be one for a while.

00:19:37.184 --> 00:19:38.424
Since your mom isn't giving you money.

00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:40.894
I'll get the money by the end of this week.

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:42.294
Sure, whatever.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.894
Wash out all the trash cans. Leave them upside down out back.

00:19:49.594 --> 00:19:50.764
Seriously... Darn it.

00:20:27.674 --> 00:20:29.474
Oh, Mom, you're home?

00:20:30.444 --> 00:20:32.004
I'm so exhausted.

00:21:14.854 --> 00:21:16.054
When I think about it,

00:21:16.724 --> 00:21:18.754
what Gang Oh said isn't completely wrong.

00:21:20.224 --> 00:21:21.624
If I hadn't been in the picture,

00:21:22.154 --> 00:21:25.194
all the money spent on raising me would've gone to Gang Oh.

00:21:26.194 --> 00:21:28.034
I don't think that's true, Eun Oh.

00:21:28.294 --> 00:21:29.294
Me neither.

00:21:29.734 --> 00:21:31.764
Hey, it was your parents' decision, you know?

00:21:33.374 --> 00:21:34.534
Of course, it was.

00:21:34.934 --> 00:21:35.974
But still...

00:21:37.344 --> 00:21:38.404
Anyway...

00:21:39.304 --> 00:21:41.914
For my mom and for Gang Oh,

00:21:42.474 --> 00:21:43.814
I've decided I need to make money.

00:21:44.944 --> 00:21:45.984
So, that's how it all happened.

00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:48.654
So that's how it happened.

00:21:49.884 --> 00:21:51.224
This is insane.

00:21:51.754 --> 00:21:53.194
What am I even supposed to say to that?

00:21:54.024 --> 00:21:55.054
Nothing.

00:21:57.594 --> 00:22:00.564
You can't really know unless you've been there yourself.

00:22:01.594 --> 00:22:03.964
It's slow today, so I'll go check on the kitchen.

00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:16.014
Gosh, I'm dying to know.

00:22:16.784 --> 00:22:17.814
Why is he just standing there?

00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:22.614
Is Seong Jae waiting for Eun Oh?

00:22:26.754 --> 00:22:27.754
Ji Hyuk.

00:22:30.624 --> 00:22:32.094
Surprised I came in without knocking?

00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:34.064
Then why did you even bother knocking?

00:22:35.564 --> 00:22:36.964
I guess I was a little impatient.

00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:38.834
I was just too curious.

00:22:40.304 --> 00:22:41.304
About what?

00:22:41.934 --> 00:22:43.474
About me offering to partner up with Eun Oh?

00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:46.304
What are you thinking?

00:22:47.914 --> 00:22:49.814
A win-win. It's business.

00:22:51.144 --> 00:22:52.644
Is that the only reason?

00:22:53.654 --> 00:22:55.084
I already told you. Why ask again?

00:22:55.814 --> 00:22:57.754
So it's really just about expanding the business?

00:22:58.084 --> 00:22:59.084
Yes.

00:23:00.224 --> 00:23:01.854
I mean, what else would there be?

00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:04.124
Of course, there is. You...

00:23:08.234 --> 00:23:09.494
(Lee Su Bin)

00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:13.734
Answer it.

00:23:14.304 --> 00:23:15.334
No, it's nothing.

00:23:15.934 --> 00:23:17.104
Look, Ji Hyuk, you...

00:23:20.814 --> 00:23:22.514
It looks important. You should take it.

00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:24.144
(Lee Su Bin)

00:23:27.314 --> 00:23:28.684
Let's talk about this later.

00:23:31.724 --> 00:23:32.884
Talk later? About what?

00:23:33.694 --> 00:23:35.354
Who does he think he is, grilling me like that?

00:23:35.724 --> 00:23:37.164
Whatever I do with Ji Eun Oh is my business.

00:23:39.464 --> 00:23:42.364
Wait, what are you talking about? Tell me exactly what's going on.

00:23:42.534 --> 00:23:43.864
They say I'm not good enough.

00:23:44.204 --> 00:23:45.864
They say I can't do it.

00:23:46.364 --> 00:23:47.874
That I'm not qualified.

00:23:48.374 --> 00:23:50.444
Apparently, I don't have what it takes...

00:23:50.444 --> 00:23:51.544
to be in the upper class.

00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:54.544
What are you talking about? Make it make sense.

00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:57.244
They said a no-name video creator like me...

00:23:57.244 --> 00:23:58.784
had no chance.

00:23:59.044 --> 00:24:01.414
They said I didn't have a proven track record.

00:24:01.954 --> 00:24:03.624
I really love doing it,

00:24:04.084 --> 00:24:06.924
and I work so hard on my videos, but my subscribers just won't go up,

00:24:06.994 --> 00:24:09.754
and all my subscribers ever ask about is you.

00:24:10.294 --> 00:24:11.824
My brother's gone,

00:24:12.524 --> 00:24:14.764
and I can't tell Dad.

00:24:14.994 --> 00:24:18.334
I definitely can't tell Mom.

00:24:18.964 --> 00:24:20.634
Gosh, why am I even telling you this...

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:22.804
You're my older brother's friend.

00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:26.404
Why am I calling you and whining like this?

00:24:27.344 --> 00:24:31.684
- Have you had a lot to drink? - I have, but that's not the point.

00:24:31.784 --> 00:24:32.784
Did you drink alone?

00:24:32.844 --> 00:24:35.214
I told you, that's not what's important!

00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:36.884
It is to me.

00:24:37.254 --> 00:24:38.384
I asked, are you alone?

00:24:38.854 --> 00:24:39.994
Or are you with a friend?

00:24:40.294 --> 00:24:43.194
Ha Eun's inside. I'm just out front.

00:24:43.624 --> 00:24:45.094
My goodness.

00:24:45.864 --> 00:24:46.964
Okay, that's good, then.

00:24:47.034 --> 00:24:49.134
But I'm not okay. Not at all.

00:24:49.194 --> 00:24:50.364
I'm a complete failure!

00:24:51.334 --> 00:24:52.904
Who said something so harsh to you?

00:24:53.474 --> 00:24:55.304
What did the people at the matchmaking agency say?

00:24:55.374 --> 00:24:58.604
Yes. That's why I'm getting a business card made.

00:24:59.044 --> 00:25:01.274
Lee Su Bin, Assistant Manager, PR Team, Songsong Electronics.

00:25:01.644 --> 00:25:03.174
That's the business card I'm going to make.

00:25:03.514 --> 00:25:08.184
I'm definitely meeting that guy. Then once he falls for me,

00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:11.354
- I'm going to dump him. - Wait, what? Songsong Electronics?

00:25:11.924 --> 00:25:13.654
Are you saying you're going to make a fake business card?

00:25:13.724 --> 00:25:16.094
Yes, I am.

00:25:16.354 --> 00:25:18.894
I'm going to test the power of a business card and a real job.

00:25:19.424 --> 00:25:21.434
People look down on me without even meeting me first.

00:25:21.934 --> 00:25:23.264
I'm going to put it to the test.

00:25:23.634 --> 00:25:26.364
I'm dying to see what he'll do once he's fallen for me.

00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:27.434
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

00:25:29.804 --> 00:25:30.804
Hey...

00:25:32.944 --> 00:25:33.944
The nerve.

00:25:36.414 --> 00:25:39.484
The phone is turned off. Transferring to voicemail...

00:25:44.484 --> 00:25:45.954
Not her too.

00:25:50.524 --> 00:25:51.524
Oh, you're here.

00:25:51.964 --> 00:25:53.294
Su Jeong.

00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:56.234
This is Cha Cheol Min. He's the new guy at Mamdaerozip.

00:25:56.494 --> 00:25:58.804
We go way back. She runs things here at the cafe.

00:25:58.864 --> 00:26:01.474
Hi. We met at the interview, right?

00:26:02.174 --> 00:26:03.174
Yes.

00:26:06.244 --> 00:26:07.344
Get back to work.

00:26:18.484 --> 00:26:21.694
Mamdaerozip's first base camp. It's a little modest, right?

00:26:22.854 --> 00:26:23.864
It's cosy.

00:26:26.164 --> 00:26:27.864
This is your desk, Cheol Min.

00:26:30.904 --> 00:26:33.574
There's something I need you to do before we start the website renewal.

00:26:34.304 --> 00:26:37.574
A banner linking to turnkey services and a "Meet the Coordinators" menu.

00:26:37.704 --> 00:26:39.244
I've looked at the website.

00:26:39.344 --> 00:26:42.714
Your growth is more explosive than I anticipated.

00:26:43.544 --> 00:26:46.384
Give me four days. Which one should I do first?

00:26:46.444 --> 00:26:47.914
That fast?

00:26:48.784 --> 00:26:51.984
Start with the turnkey link banner. Like this.

00:26:52.984 --> 00:26:56.554
This will take a day and a half. Four days total for both.

00:26:56.794 --> 00:26:57.794
Maybe even faster.

00:26:59.724 --> 00:27:02.264
- I'm impressed. - Oh, and one more thing.

00:27:02.264 --> 00:27:05.864
Your portfolio doesn't stand out. "Coordinator 2 and 3" are generic.

00:27:06.064 --> 00:27:10.844
Coordinator 2, Yeonnam-dong Apt. Coordinator 3, Bulgwang-dong Villa.

00:27:11.604 --> 00:27:13.744
You need specific titles like these.

00:27:13.814 --> 00:27:15.874
Well, that's going to be your job from now on.

00:27:16.244 --> 00:27:17.384
I know.

00:27:18.484 --> 00:27:22.154
Think you can handle all that plus developing the new website?

00:27:22.214 --> 00:27:25.054
It seems a Q and A section is essential for the new site too.

00:27:25.524 --> 00:27:27.024
Did you read my mind or something?

00:27:27.124 --> 00:27:29.324
Well, then, I'll get started.

00:27:29.394 --> 00:27:32.224
You won't hear the notifications if you wear those.

00:27:32.324 --> 00:27:35.594
I have eyes, so I can see the board.

00:27:42.974 --> 00:27:43.974
Okay.

00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:48.314
Turnkey services are available.

00:27:48.614 --> 00:27:51.784
The type and size of your home, the expected construction duration,

00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:53.414
and your desired budget.

00:27:53.584 --> 00:27:57.084
Please email us your project scope, and we will get back to you.

00:27:57.384 --> 00:28:00.794
Also, please note there's a fee for a cost estimate.

00:28:04.764 --> 00:28:07.634
Yes. Ohyang-dong, got it.

00:28:08.164 --> 00:28:11.004
Oh, really? Five other projects nearby?

00:28:11.534 --> 00:28:14.204
Oh, yes, of course. We can minimize demolition noise.

00:28:14.274 --> 00:28:15.274
Right.

00:28:17.144 --> 00:28:18.874
You heard about our work on the Hyunmyeong Apartments?

00:28:23.214 --> 00:28:26.914
Wear black pants and shoes. Please keep your appearance neat.

00:28:44.904 --> 00:28:49.574
Hello, these are freshly cooked and delicious.

00:28:49.634 --> 00:28:50.744
Care for a sample?

00:28:54.774 --> 00:28:55.844
Hello, ma'am...

00:29:06.824 --> 00:29:10.324
Oh, excuse me! We have delicious pollack fritters.

00:29:10.394 --> 00:29:11.394
Care for a sample?

00:29:16.364 --> 00:29:19.804
Would you like one? Oh, sure. Here you go.

00:29:19.964 --> 00:29:22.034
Thank you. Enjoy!

00:29:26.874 --> 00:29:29.144
Ok Rye? You're early today.

00:29:29.214 --> 00:29:32.244
- Yes. - Oh, my! "Ok Rye?"

00:29:32.344 --> 00:29:33.544
Are you two dating?

00:29:34.384 --> 00:29:36.184
Oh, no, we're not.

00:29:36.284 --> 00:29:39.524
We've been friends since we were young.

00:29:39.584 --> 00:29:42.324
Then how come you two acted like strangers before?

00:29:42.694 --> 00:29:46.824
I didn't recognise her at first. It's been decades.

00:29:46.924 --> 00:29:49.064
Oh, I see.

00:29:50.164 --> 00:29:52.364
Anyway, I was asking why you came so early today.

00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:56.174
I'm almost at 1,000. Don't distract me.

00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:07.784
Oh, thank you. Enjoy!

00:30:07.854 --> 00:30:09.684
- Hope business is good! - Thanks.

00:30:09.814 --> 00:30:11.384
(Chuseok Special: Pollack Fritters)

00:30:14.194 --> 00:30:16.424
- Da Jeong. - Hey.

00:30:16.754 --> 00:30:18.694
- Your legs must be killing you. - Yes.

00:30:19.294 --> 00:30:20.894
But it's been manageable.

00:30:21.264 --> 00:30:23.364
Prop your legs on a cushion tonight.

00:30:23.364 --> 00:30:25.234
They could be swollen in the morning.

00:30:25.634 --> 00:30:26.804
I'll have to do that.

00:30:26.864 --> 00:30:29.934
Go on and get ready to clock out. Leave when the night shift arrives.

00:30:30.004 --> 00:30:31.544
Thanks, Myeong Hui.

00:30:31.774 --> 00:30:35.314
Thanks to you, I got to try this job that lets me get off before dinner.

00:30:36.014 --> 00:30:39.414
Well, it's lucky this was just a temporary gig for the event.

00:30:39.514 --> 00:30:41.214
It's not easy hiding a job from your mother-in-law...

00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:42.484
and Sang Cheol.

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:46.654
- You should just tell them. - I can't do that.

00:30:47.254 --> 00:30:48.754
My husband wouldn't stand for it.

00:30:52.494 --> 00:30:55.064
So, even after you move in,

00:30:55.064 --> 00:30:57.234
call me right away if you have issues.

00:30:57.304 --> 00:31:01.034
Okay. But your inspection was so thorough.

00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:03.904
- I doubt I'll find anything. - You never know.

00:31:04.244 --> 00:31:05.544
Okay, I will.

00:31:05.804 --> 00:31:08.044
Oh, and really, thanks to you,

00:31:08.114 --> 00:31:12.314
I learned how to cut costs and where to invest wisely.

00:31:12.384 --> 00:31:13.384
Thank you so much.

00:31:13.444 --> 00:31:17.654
I should be thanking you. You were a pleasure to work with.

00:31:18.384 --> 00:31:21.094
This is just a little something.

00:31:21.224 --> 00:31:23.894
It's some hand cream and rice cakes for you.

00:31:25.664 --> 00:31:28.534
Oh! How did you know I was almost out of hand cream?

00:31:28.934 --> 00:31:31.934
Thank you. I'll put them to good use.

00:32:05.464 --> 00:32:07.064
Ms. Ji?

00:32:11.574 --> 00:32:13.144
My gosh, when did you get here?

00:32:13.644 --> 00:32:15.444
I thought you were studying.

00:32:17.044 --> 00:32:20.684
I left the milk money over there. And the rice cakes in front of it...

00:32:20.784 --> 00:32:24.284
A client gave them to me today to celebrate the end of the project.

00:32:24.454 --> 00:32:28.024
I actually bought the milk to have with rice cakes for dinner.

00:32:28.124 --> 00:32:31.524
Gosh, I didn't mean to make you feel like you had to repay me.

00:32:31.924 --> 00:32:33.994
This isn't because of the sandwich.

00:32:34.134 --> 00:32:36.994
I'm serious. I got three of these boxes.

00:32:38.364 --> 00:32:42.734
But if you just leave these things, how would I know what you bought?

00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:45.574
Oh, I was going to text you later.

00:32:46.704 --> 00:32:48.544
You have my number?

00:32:48.644 --> 00:32:51.544
Yes. It's in my notes from the Mapo site.

00:32:54.554 --> 00:32:56.714
Well, anyway... I'll enjoy the rice cakes. Thanks.

00:32:58.554 --> 00:32:59.754
Good luck with your exam.

00:33:00.794 --> 00:33:02.354
You even know about my exam?

00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:06.294
After your first day on my site, I asked you to come back, but...

00:33:06.424 --> 00:33:08.064
you said you couldn't because you had class.

00:33:11.504 --> 00:33:12.834
You were attending classes and studying...

00:33:12.834 --> 00:33:15.674
special DC machines, generators, and induced voltage direction.

00:33:15.734 --> 00:33:18.044
When I saw you studying all that,

00:33:18.444 --> 00:33:20.144
I figured it had to be the Certified Electrician Exam.

00:33:20.714 --> 00:33:23.174
Oh, my. How did you know that?

00:33:24.084 --> 00:33:26.084
The people I work with every day...

00:33:26.114 --> 00:33:29.584
are carpenters, electricians, and engineers.

00:33:30.354 --> 00:33:31.824
My goodness.

00:33:32.184 --> 00:33:34.024
I can't get anything past you, can I?

00:33:43.864 --> 00:33:46.804
- He wants you in the office now. - Who does?

00:33:49.034 --> 00:33:50.034
You'd better go.

00:34:03.924 --> 00:34:07.354
I'd like you to meet someone. He's redoing Mamdaerozip's site...

00:34:07.424 --> 00:34:10.724
and managing it, Cha Cheol Min. And this is the CEO of Eunoism.

00:34:10.824 --> 00:34:14.564
Manager Ji Eun Oh will be our turnkey partner at Mamdaerozip.

00:34:15.464 --> 00:34:19.364
- I'm Cha Cheol Min. - You're the full-stack developer.

00:34:19.364 --> 00:34:20.634
(Full-stack: Builds front-end and back-end independently.)

00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:23.904
Yes, he was a computer science major.

00:34:25.204 --> 00:34:26.874
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

00:34:27.974 --> 00:34:29.944
So, should we take this meeting elsewhere?

00:34:32.584 --> 00:34:37.484
Of our four turnkey clients, one sent a floor plan they measured,

00:34:37.554 --> 00:34:39.354
and I've already measured two.

00:34:40.354 --> 00:34:41.754
You've already done the measurements?

00:34:41.824 --> 00:34:43.754
I'll get the last one measured by the day after tomorrow.

00:34:48.494 --> 00:34:51.634
- Hey, but... - Mr. Lee.

00:34:52.234 --> 00:34:53.234
Sorry?

00:34:55.434 --> 00:34:57.274
Why are you calling me "Hey?" We're partners.

00:34:58.174 --> 00:34:59.974
Oh, right.

00:35:00.914 --> 00:35:01.914
Mr. Lee.

00:35:02.414 --> 00:35:03.414
Go on.

00:35:05.784 --> 00:35:07.684
What does this star symbol mean?

00:35:08.254 --> 00:35:09.754
My gut says they're likely to ask for an estimate.

00:35:10.184 --> 00:35:12.454
They readily agreed when I mentioned the estimate fee.

00:35:13.254 --> 00:35:14.754
You charge for estimates?

00:35:15.454 --> 00:35:18.624
People trying to get free expertise when they're still on the fence...

00:35:18.764 --> 00:35:19.964
and just walk away with it?

00:35:21.134 --> 00:35:23.034
That's not how we do things here.

00:35:26.604 --> 00:35:29.974
These are the designer profiles from Mr. Jo Gyeong Su.

00:35:30.744 --> 00:35:31.744
You make the call.

00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:33.304
Me?

00:35:34.344 --> 00:35:35.944
Okay, I will.

00:35:36.674 --> 00:35:37.844
Text me if you run into any problems.

00:35:52.324 --> 00:35:53.894
We only signed the contract yesterday,

00:35:54.234 --> 00:35:56.334
and he's already this far along?

00:35:58.904 --> 00:35:59.904
Hey, Eun Oh.

00:36:00.264 --> 00:36:01.904
Why was Ji Hyuk being so formal with you?

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:05.774
We're business partners now. We agreed to keep it professional.

00:36:06.674 --> 00:36:09.144
But it wasn't just the formality.

00:36:09.544 --> 00:36:10.714
It was... What's the word? Yes.

00:36:11.084 --> 00:36:12.844
He was all business with you.

00:36:13.784 --> 00:36:14.984
That's what I wanted.

00:36:15.484 --> 00:36:17.384
We made an agreement, so we should stick to it.

00:36:18.354 --> 00:36:20.894
- Isn't it awkward for you? - It's a little weird, but...

00:36:21.654 --> 00:36:22.654
I prefer it that way.

00:36:23.594 --> 00:36:26.594
I don't know. Ji Hyuk seemed totally different.

00:36:28.134 --> 00:36:32.264
- He's always been a go-getter. - True.

00:36:33.364 --> 00:36:35.974
- Hey. - Oh, welcome.

00:36:39.644 --> 00:36:42.314
But he must be getting tons of coordination requests too.

00:36:43.244 --> 00:36:45.114
So why did he spend all day just on the turnkey project?

00:36:57.564 --> 00:36:58.564
Go get some dinner.

00:36:59.564 --> 00:37:01.364
- Can I just have some cup noodles? - No!

00:37:01.864 --> 00:37:02.894
Sorry?

00:37:03.794 --> 00:37:05.634
That's not what I meant. It's just...

00:37:06.004 --> 00:37:08.504
You can't eat in the office. You have to eat outside the cafe.

00:37:08.874 --> 00:37:09.874
Out the back door.

00:37:10.304 --> 00:37:11.374
Okay.

00:37:13.544 --> 00:37:14.544
What about you?

00:37:15.044 --> 00:37:16.944
I'm not hungry. And I don't have time.

00:37:18.214 --> 00:37:20.714
Look, you're working late on your first day.

00:37:20.784 --> 00:37:22.084
I'm sorry we can't even grab a bite together.

00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:24.654
That's actually better for me.

00:37:34.164 --> 00:37:35.164
In that case, here.

00:37:36.264 --> 00:37:41.104
This is a list of potential clients I filtered from today's requests.

00:37:41.834 --> 00:37:43.574
I've organised their info,

00:37:43.574 --> 00:37:46.604
including contact details, address, timeline, and scope.

00:37:46.674 --> 00:37:49.644
Wait, you organised all this and printed it out?

00:37:50.174 --> 00:37:53.444
Well... If you don't like it, I can email it to you from now on.

00:37:53.544 --> 00:37:54.554
No.

00:37:55.384 --> 00:37:58.654
You're much quicker than I expected. Really, thank you. This is great.

00:38:00.824 --> 00:38:03.954
Behind that are coordinator resumes that came through the company email,

00:38:04.024 --> 00:38:05.324
and I printed out their portfolios too.

00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:16.874
(Gangha-dong blueprints)

00:38:19.874 --> 00:38:21.974
(Gangha-dong apartment client brief)

00:38:25.284 --> 00:38:26.384
He does a bit of everything.

00:38:45.904 --> 00:38:47.704
(The last bus!)

00:38:49.534 --> 00:38:50.534
What was that?

00:38:52.674 --> 00:38:53.674
She hasn't left?

00:38:54.614 --> 00:38:56.114
Is she planning to pull an all-nighter here?

00:38:58.584 --> 00:39:00.684
Man, Ji Eun Oh is fearless to a fault.

00:39:01.114 --> 00:39:03.414
If I were her, I'd be too scared to even go out after what happened.

00:39:07.354 --> 00:39:08.354
What?

00:39:22.074 --> 00:39:23.074
She's leaving now?

00:39:26.744 --> 00:39:27.944
She should've left earlier.

00:39:33.984 --> 00:39:35.254
Did she book a taxi?

00:39:48.134 --> 00:39:50.134
What, she didn't book a taxi?

00:39:51.004 --> 00:39:53.664
She shouldn't just hail any taxi. She needs to book one! Book it!

00:39:56.634 --> 00:39:57.744
No way.

00:40:00.204 --> 00:40:02.074
What? She's taking the bus?

00:40:03.274 --> 00:40:05.684
Are you kidding me? It's a long walk from the bus stop to her house.

00:40:06.684 --> 00:40:08.254
She's so unbelievably reckless.

00:40:10.154 --> 00:40:11.784
I'm scared walking home at night,

00:40:12.054 --> 00:40:13.424
so I leave before the last bus.

00:40:13.854 --> 00:40:16.824
I even wear my dad's jacket and a hat.

00:40:18.264 --> 00:40:19.264
Goodness.

00:40:25.204 --> 00:40:27.104
Even when she was making good money at Doogle, she was like this.

00:40:27.874 --> 00:40:29.274
I've never once seen her take a cab.

00:40:29.634 --> 00:40:30.634
Seriously?

00:40:35.744 --> 00:40:36.774
She's not a kid anymore.

00:40:37.274 --> 00:40:39.284
Does she really still have to catch the last bus?

00:41:45.584 --> 00:41:47.014
What am I doing?

00:41:48.054 --> 00:41:49.114
She's not my junior anymore.

00:41:49.854 --> 00:41:52.854
Why so worried about a partner? Don't you have better things to do?

00:41:53.554 --> 00:41:58.564
Don't give her a second thought. But why not? She's my partner.

00:41:59.964 --> 00:42:02.064
Instead, I'll just have to give her a serious warning.

00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:04.264
She's fearless, after all she's been through.

00:42:05.034 --> 00:42:06.034
Unbelievable.

00:42:06.464 --> 00:42:07.464
My gosh.

00:42:18.444 --> 00:42:19.444
What?

00:42:20.214 --> 00:42:22.014
Hey, what's wrong?

00:42:23.754 --> 00:42:24.924
It's 2:30am.

00:42:25.554 --> 00:42:26.554
Why aren't you in bed?

00:42:27.084 --> 00:42:29.654
Oh, you go ahead and sleep. I'm just going to finish this up.

00:42:30.354 --> 00:42:31.724
When's the exam, anyway?

00:42:32.094 --> 00:42:33.864
You stay up past 3am every single night.

00:42:34.124 --> 00:42:36.294
It's fine. They haven't announced the date yet.

00:42:37.934 --> 00:42:40.834
Doesn't studying in this room remind you of Ji Hyuk?

00:42:42.374 --> 00:42:43.374
You miss him, don't you?

00:42:46.904 --> 00:42:48.074
Okay, all right.

00:42:49.514 --> 00:42:50.974
Just try not to stay up past 3am, okay?

00:43:02.524 --> 00:43:05.794
Get two and freeze them. They'll last until Chuseok.

00:43:05.894 --> 00:43:07.224
- All right. - Great.

00:43:07.294 --> 00:43:08.564
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

00:43:09.664 --> 00:43:12.504
Try our pollack fritters. It's tender and not fishy at all.

00:43:13.104 --> 00:43:15.974
Kids absolutely love it. Here, try a sample.

00:43:17.534 --> 00:43:19.174
- Is it good? - Yes.

00:43:19.244 --> 00:43:20.244
- I'll take one, please. - Sure.

00:43:20.304 --> 00:43:23.244
- Here you go. Thank you. Enjoy. - Thank you.

00:43:25.284 --> 00:43:27.014
- Da Jeong. - Hey.

00:43:27.084 --> 00:43:28.684
I'm going to get some eel. You want any?

00:43:28.954 --> 00:43:32.024
It's 40 percent off at closing time. It's high-quality and tastes great.

00:43:32.124 --> 00:43:34.724
Eel? My husband loves eel.

00:43:34.894 --> 00:43:37.824
You get paid today, so splurge. Treat the family.

00:43:38.564 --> 00:43:39.564
Maybe I should.

00:43:42.634 --> 00:43:46.164
Last two. Okay, good.

00:43:46.264 --> 00:43:47.564
All right, that's it for today.

00:43:49.204 --> 00:43:52.174
- Be sure to do cool-down stretches. - Okay, thank you.

00:43:58.484 --> 00:43:59.484
Hello.

00:44:01.654 --> 00:44:03.414
We're here so often. We should introduce ourselves.

00:44:06.154 --> 00:44:07.384
I'd rather not.

00:44:08.024 --> 00:44:09.024
This is making me uncomfortable.

00:44:09.954 --> 00:44:11.664
Then how are we supposed to introduce ourselves?

00:44:12.194 --> 00:44:13.594
And why would we do that?

00:44:18.004 --> 00:44:20.304
I wonder what kind of family she comes from. She's so guarded.

00:44:21.134 --> 00:44:22.134
Excuse me, wait!

00:44:27.844 --> 00:44:32.584
We see each other here all the time. It's members-only, we're all vetted.

00:44:34.514 --> 00:44:36.414
(Managing Director Min Jung Ho, Hyeonyu Department Store)

00:44:52.534 --> 00:44:53.534
Wait for me in the car.

00:44:54.504 --> 00:44:56.234
- Why? - Yeong Ra.

00:44:58.144 --> 00:44:59.144
That was quick.

00:45:04.444 --> 00:45:06.244
Oh, you must be her driver.

00:45:08.984 --> 00:45:09.984
Shall we?

00:45:17.394 --> 00:45:18.664
What's going on here?

00:45:20.894 --> 00:45:23.594
I'm only here because I don't want to be bothered while I work out.

00:45:24.064 --> 00:45:25.704
So please get to the point.

00:45:26.304 --> 00:45:28.604
My point is that I want to talk to you, Yeong Ra.

00:45:31.104 --> 00:45:32.574
My name is Min Jung Ho.

00:45:32.944 --> 00:45:35.674
I was studying in the US and just came back three months ago.

00:45:36.044 --> 00:45:38.044
And now, I'm learning the ropes at Hyeonyu Department Store.

00:45:38.044 --> 00:45:39.084
(Managing Director Min Jung Ho)

00:45:39.784 --> 00:45:41.484
I don't have a business card.

00:45:41.854 --> 00:45:44.084
I'm in my last semester of grad school.

00:45:44.514 --> 00:45:46.354
- Art school. - Art school?

00:45:47.384 --> 00:45:48.394
What's your major?

00:45:51.824 --> 00:45:55.194
Oh, right. I'm just the driver.

00:46:06.244 --> 00:46:08.544
I'll see you then. I'll be in touch, Yeong Ra.

00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:29.364
So, what was that all about?

00:46:31.534 --> 00:46:34.874
- He goes to my gym. - That I know.

00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:37.374
Hey, Park Yeong Ra.

00:46:37.904 --> 00:46:42.674
Why are you meeting a stranger? What if your mom finds out?

00:46:43.074 --> 00:46:44.744
This is what my mom wants.

00:46:46.044 --> 00:46:47.614
What?

00:46:48.284 --> 00:46:49.514
It's complicated.

00:46:49.784 --> 00:46:51.524
You're saying your mom made you do this?

00:46:51.784 --> 00:46:55.194
To talk to any random guy and agree to a date?

00:46:56.354 --> 00:46:59.724
Okay, let me ask you something I'm really curious about.

00:47:00.094 --> 00:47:02.964
Why do you only do exactly what your mom tells you?

00:47:03.834 --> 00:47:06.804
I mean, forget everything else. Just take your webtoons for example.

00:47:06.964 --> 00:47:09.104
Clearly, you're very talented.

00:47:09.104 --> 00:47:11.304
So why paint instead of drawing more webtoons?

00:47:11.404 --> 00:47:13.904
Why do I have to be a webtoon artist?

00:47:14.074 --> 00:47:15.214
Well, because you're so good at it.

00:47:16.774 --> 00:47:20.214
Actually, never mind. I've never seen your paintings,

00:47:20.484 --> 00:47:22.014
so I can't really judge, but...

00:47:22.514 --> 00:47:25.154
From what I've seen, you have a real talent for webtoons.

00:47:25.454 --> 00:47:29.224
That file you sent? I couldn't stop. It was just that good.

00:47:30.124 --> 00:47:31.124
Really?

00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:33.294
How many times do I have to say it? It's good.

00:47:34.764 --> 00:47:38.334
Did you find the corrupted file yet? The one from the middle.

00:47:39.334 --> 00:47:40.504
Oh, that's right!

00:47:40.804 --> 00:47:42.404
I need to call my mom.

00:47:43.834 --> 00:47:46.074
Ms. Jang isn't one to be late.

00:47:46.374 --> 00:47:47.974
I'm sure you'll get the required number of pieces.

00:47:48.914 --> 00:47:52.784
If you guarantee it, Professor Kim, I suppose I have no reason to worry.

00:47:53.414 --> 00:47:57.784
Please make sure Yeong Ra studies the artist's note thoroughly.

00:47:58.124 --> 00:48:01.394
Whatever questions she's asked, she's the one who has to answer.

00:48:01.524 --> 00:48:04.294
This Flower Painting Series originated with Yeong Ra.

00:48:05.194 --> 00:48:06.824
Oh, of course. I understand.

00:48:06.894 --> 00:48:07.894
Absolutely.

00:48:12.564 --> 00:48:14.404
I know you're busy, so I'll get going.

00:48:15.404 --> 00:48:16.404
Oh, just a moment.

00:48:34.454 --> 00:48:35.854
This perfume smells wonderful.

00:48:36.424 --> 00:48:38.194
Oh, thank you.

00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:41.294
After the exhibition, I'll have to get you an even nicer one.

00:48:55.744 --> 00:48:58.144
I had tea with Min Jung Ho today.

00:48:59.284 --> 00:49:00.284
You did?

00:49:03.314 --> 00:49:04.314
(My Daughter Yeong Ra)

00:49:07.454 --> 00:49:08.894
You're on your way to the studio, right?

00:49:10.154 --> 00:49:11.154
What about the next date?

00:49:14.224 --> 00:49:17.064
Oh, really? You turned him down at first, right?

00:49:17.894 --> 00:49:21.434
Yes. He offered his business card, but I refused.

00:49:21.904 --> 00:49:24.274
You must be with the driver, and Jang's at the studio.

00:49:24.274 --> 00:49:25.804
Let's talk about the details at home.

00:49:39.254 --> 00:49:41.454
What did I just hear?

00:49:42.194 --> 00:49:43.194
Then again, it makes sense.

00:49:43.494 --> 00:49:44.524
You don't have to say anything.

00:49:45.294 --> 00:49:46.994
I wasn't going to.

00:49:47.824 --> 00:49:49.034
No, I mean...

00:49:49.564 --> 00:49:52.664
You were trying to become a painter just so you could get married.

00:49:52.834 --> 00:49:57.034
So that's why you quit your webtoon. Because your mom told you to. Right?

00:49:57.574 --> 00:49:58.574
Yes.

00:49:58.944 --> 00:50:01.104
Then about "Take My Heart."

00:50:01.204 --> 00:50:03.574
Is it going to be your only webtoon?

00:50:05.014 --> 00:50:06.044
I suppose so.

00:50:06.114 --> 00:50:08.684
Well, then you have to tell me the rest of the story.

00:50:09.184 --> 00:50:12.254
No, you should finish it. At least for your own sake.

00:50:17.754 --> 00:50:19.994
- Hey. - Yes?

00:50:20.464 --> 00:50:21.464
It's just that...

00:50:23.464 --> 00:50:25.734
Do you really think it's good?

00:50:26.864 --> 00:50:28.634
What are you going to do if I say yes?

00:50:28.974 --> 00:50:31.134
You won't tell me what's next. You're so weird.

00:50:31.404 --> 00:50:35.514
I've said it's great so many times, and I'm dying to know what happens,

00:50:35.674 --> 00:50:36.774
and you're asking me again?

00:50:37.514 --> 00:50:39.444
No, that's not what I mean.

00:50:41.814 --> 00:50:45.984
In the middle, So Ri asks Dokgo Chan to teach her how to fight.

00:50:46.654 --> 00:50:50.424
But I'm stuck on the fight scenes, so I'm sketching them separately.

00:50:51.694 --> 00:50:55.364
Could you give me some pointers? Since you studied PE.

00:50:55.934 --> 00:50:58.934
I can't create a fighting style that really feels like So Ri.

00:51:00.534 --> 00:51:01.534
Is that right?

00:51:02.274 --> 00:51:03.804
Okay, let me see.

00:51:16.184 --> 00:51:18.784
Hey, what is this?

00:51:19.184 --> 00:51:22.994
Hey, it's a guy with long hair fighting a guy with short hair.

00:51:23.354 --> 00:51:24.624
Exactly.

00:51:25.524 --> 00:51:28.464
Okay, Yeong Ra. Look, for this character...

00:51:28.994 --> 00:51:31.364
So Ri used to be a ballet dancer, right?

00:51:31.864 --> 00:51:34.664
So her fighting style and all her moves...

00:51:34.734 --> 00:51:37.174
Shouldn't you draw them to look more like a ballerina's?

00:51:38.444 --> 00:51:39.574
Like a ballerina?

00:51:39.904 --> 00:51:41.974
Yes, exactly. Like a ballerina.

00:51:42.274 --> 00:51:46.144
She should fight with elegant turns and graceful footwork.

00:51:46.314 --> 00:51:48.784
Imagine her hair flowing in the moonlight...

00:51:48.854 --> 00:51:51.554
Something like this. Wouldn't that be cool?

00:52:19.544 --> 00:52:20.544
Dokgo Chan!

00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:22.574
My, you drew her as I described. She's exactly the So Ri I pictured.

00:53:22.944 --> 00:53:26.284
- Yeong Ra, you're so talented. - Really?

00:53:26.344 --> 00:53:27.344
Yes.

00:53:36.524 --> 00:53:38.424
So you were being serious?

00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:42.064
If you ask me ten more times, it'll make it a hundred.

00:53:42.494 --> 00:53:44.264
A business card for a Songsong Group PR team employee.

00:53:45.034 --> 00:53:47.404
If you actually make one, you know that's document forgery, right?

00:53:48.874 --> 00:53:50.804
You've said that a dozen times too.

00:53:53.544 --> 00:53:55.314
What am I going to do with you, Su Bin?

00:53:56.314 --> 00:53:59.484
Why are you so stubborn? Don't you see how crazy this is?

00:54:00.184 --> 00:54:03.484
- Mind your own business and go. - Mind my own business?

00:54:04.054 --> 00:54:05.584
How can I mind my own business?

00:54:05.854 --> 00:54:08.184
You're Ji Hyuk's little sister, and I know your parents too.

00:54:08.624 --> 00:54:11.494
And you're going to forge documents just to go on a date with some guy?

00:54:11.824 --> 00:54:13.624
Am I supposed to just stand by and watch you become a criminal?

00:54:15.864 --> 00:54:16.864
Look.

00:54:17.134 --> 00:54:19.534
I won't become a criminal if you just keep your mouth shut.

00:54:20.434 --> 00:54:23.474
I'll make him fall for me before he finds out my card is fake.

00:54:23.604 --> 00:54:24.934
A month is all I need.

00:54:25.974 --> 00:54:26.974
Su Bin.

00:54:27.374 --> 00:54:31.274
You can't just make someone fall for you.

00:54:31.414 --> 00:54:33.244
That's what you think.

00:54:34.014 --> 00:54:35.384
This is unbelievable.

00:54:37.284 --> 00:54:38.584
You see,

00:54:38.884 --> 00:54:42.394
I have to do this, or I'll regret it forever.

00:54:43.094 --> 00:54:45.694
The moment I saw his picture, I just knew he was the one.

00:54:46.194 --> 00:54:47.764
I've never felt that way before.

00:54:48.064 --> 00:54:50.594
He has everything I've ever wanted in a man.

00:54:50.964 --> 00:54:52.534
He's even good-looking.

00:54:52.534 --> 00:54:54.504
But just because I don't have a real job,

00:54:54.904 --> 00:54:59.274
I have to give up without trying? I can't stand that.

00:55:03.414 --> 00:55:04.514
Lee Su Bin.

00:55:04.814 --> 00:55:06.044
Are you really...

00:55:06.814 --> 00:55:08.984
confident that you can make him genuinely fall for you?

00:55:09.054 --> 00:55:10.384
Yes, I am.

00:55:10.454 --> 00:55:13.024
And if he does fall for you, like you say he will,

00:55:13.554 --> 00:55:15.854
are you going to tell him you'll quit to be a content creator?

00:55:15.924 --> 00:55:16.924
Yes.

00:55:27.434 --> 00:55:28.434

00:55:45.354 --> 00:55:46.584
For all four of them?

00:55:47.354 --> 00:55:48.354
That was fast.

00:55:49.124 --> 00:55:51.654
But why are you giving this to me?

00:55:52.624 --> 00:55:54.564
What do you mean?

00:55:54.994 --> 00:55:58.134
You make all the turnkey decisions, Ms. Ji.

00:55:59.264 --> 00:56:03.334
Once you confirm the blueprints and set the construction schedule,

00:56:03.434 --> 00:56:06.074
I just supply materials and labour and get my commission. That's it.

00:56:07.044 --> 00:56:11.144
But it's our first project together. Shouldn't you check on the process?

00:56:12.114 --> 00:56:13.884
No. If I were going to do that, why would we even be partners?

00:56:14.484 --> 00:56:18.214
I'd make more money on my own. Haven't you seen our website?

00:56:18.414 --> 00:56:19.924
We're flooded with new jobs.

00:56:20.654 --> 00:56:22.454

00:56:31.164 --> 00:56:34.064
So, I can pick any designers I want...

00:56:34.134 --> 00:56:37.674
and assign the projects as I see fit?

00:56:37.934 --> 00:56:41.474
First, send out the estimates, and have the client sign off.

00:56:42.514 --> 00:56:45.714

00:56:46.414 --> 00:56:48.384
I've already reviewed all the designer portfolios.

00:56:48.914 --> 00:56:50.654
Remember I mentioned Mr. Jo Gyeong Su, the team lead?

00:56:51.014 --> 00:56:55.024
He's working remotely, so I'll send his number for you to coordinate.

00:56:55.724 --> 00:56:56.724
Okay.

00:56:57.794 --> 00:57:00.224
Okay, so send these quotes to the clients,

00:57:00.294 --> 00:57:03.464
and you don't need to report to me until the projects are finalized.

00:57:06.234 --> 00:57:09.074
