Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.620
But you’re a vampire.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.700
You’re immortal.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.440
How could you possibly understand?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.190
You should go, Mr. Ramil.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.860
Go back to your duties.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.100
Let’s not see each other again.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.420
Between a human and a vampire, it’s impossible.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.710
I’m ready.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.000
Yes, Master.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.040
Follow me.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.020
Where are you taking me?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.760
You’re in danger.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.780
I’m taking you out of here.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.960
Please, Mr. Ramil.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.780
Just follow me.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.780
This is my territory.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.070
I’m not going anywhere.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.770
Now,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020
will you give in and come with me?

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.759
If you promise to let me kiss you again,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.580
I will.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.590
I promise.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.520
Tell me what’s going on.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.300
The Hunters have planned to kill you
during the inauguration ceremony tonight.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.900
You’re not safe.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.940
I can’t let you die.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.790
Mr. Ramil!

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.060
2 HOURS EARLIER

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.340
This is our plan for tonight.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.800
We’ll divide into two teams.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.420
The first team will be ready with weapons,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.150
waiting for my and Elise’s orders outside.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.980
The second team will be led
by Paul and Caster.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.380
Tonight,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.280
we’re going to infiltrate their party.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.300
What did you spray on me, idiot?

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.040
It freaking stinks.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.910
That’s to help you disguise yourself,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.120
so the vampires won’t be able to smell you.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.380
That’s supposed to reduce the smell?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.320
Yeah.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.920
Are you sure you used the right bottle?

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.460
It freaking stinks.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.740
I invented this new formula.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.520
No matter how good the vampires’ noses
are, they won’t be able to smell you.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.580
Why are you staring at me?

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.830
Finish getting dressed.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.280
Damn, it freaking stinks.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.220
Come on.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.890
Tell every unit to stand by
and wait for my orders.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:24.550
Yes, sir.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.670
All units stand by and wait for orders.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.310
Repeat. All units stand by
and wait for orders.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.900
Follow me.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.580
(Jett, Punn barged into the party.)

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.970
Hey.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.920
Hey, let’s go over there next.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.200
Hey!

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.740
Mekhin!

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.830
Mekhin!

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.130
Mekhin!

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.390
Come on, you quack doctor!

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.820
Use your power to heal yourself.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.640
I’ve already used my power a lot.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.960
Slowly get up.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.200
You really messed with me last time

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.900
when you stormed into my bar.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.990
Do you have any idea
how much I had to pay for the damages?

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.620
And the economy sucks right now, you jerk!

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.940
Ordinary humans like you

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.140
can never defeat an immortal clan like us.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.190
It’s alright, Ciar.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.059
You rest with Mekhin.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:43.539
I’ll take it from here.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.780
Mr. Ramil, get yourself together.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.210
Mr. Ramil!

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.460
Push yourself.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.380
Punn!

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.170
Punn!

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.780
Are you okay, Punn?

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.520
I’m fine.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.180
Don’t kill them.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.780
Only if you let me use my powers on them.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.260
Go ahead.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:17.980
Punn,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
I only ordered them to drop their weapons

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.740
and go home.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.380
Mr. Ramil,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.380
you can’t go in there.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.740
I won’t leave them.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.580
Jett will never stop

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.000
until he kills you.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.990
It’s okay, Punn.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.460
Wait for me here.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.860
I’ll be back as soon as I can.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.690
No, I’m going with you.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.860
You’re too slow for a master of speed.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.020
Mr. Jett.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.770
Why welcome your guest with that face?

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.580
Are you still upset about the painting?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.140
No need to beat around the bush
like last time.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.510
Just tell me what you want.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.210
It’s not you I want to talk to.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.540
Then talk to me.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.020
We’ve never had any problems before.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.040
Why are you killing
so many of my clan members?

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.580
Please don’t act like a hero
who’s never had blood on your hands.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.770
Vampires have been hunting humans
and drinking their blood forever.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.050
The race that exploits

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.780
and kills people needs to be wiped out.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.270
How is that different from
humans hunting animals for food?

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.910
Shut up, butler.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.200
I’m not talking to you.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.620
You must have a personal grudge
against me.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.380
What did you tell him now?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.770
I figured it out on my own.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.720
Punn never wanted to betray you guys.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.400
If he hadn’t betrayed me,

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.590
you wouldn’t be standing here.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.550
It’s all your fault, Punn.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.830
You didn’t kill Ramil,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.470
so I’m going to kill him myself.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.140
No, Punn!

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.320
You still want to help him?

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.740
I’m not sure.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.750
About what?

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.980
The timing. Mr. Ramil was trapped
inside the painting for a hundred years.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.420
How could he have killed everyone
at the Michael Orphanage?

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.980
That was 10 years ago.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.740
But you’re the one who told me
about that necklace.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.730
I told you I saw the necklace before,

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.970
but I’m not sure if it was him that night

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.300
and I’m not even sure

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.160
what really went down.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.310
Neither are you guys.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.130
We were children.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:00.940
Our memories as children
could be wrong, Jett.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.370
Isn’t that right?

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.920
Isn’t that right, Elise?

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.350
Stop stalling for time.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.300
You may have misunderstood,

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.580
but I founded the Hunters to kill them.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.580
If you don’t move,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.060
I’ll kill you along with them.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.650
Kill him, Elise!

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.460
Mr. Ramil!

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.660
Master!

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.440
No!

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.700
Master!

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.140
I heard a lot of people coming this way.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.270
Can you use your power to heal yourself?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.780
Then can you help him escape, Mr. Punn?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.060
It’s not safe here.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.530
What about you, Methus?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.590
Don’t worry about me.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.140
I’ll buy you some time.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.180
Can you please go heal yourself
and hurry back?

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.580
You mean you want me to go inside—

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.290
Yes.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.580
Please help him, Mr. Punn.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.940
Mr. Ramil.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.330
Sit here.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.080
There he is!

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.180
Mr. Ramil.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:15.980
Where did he go?

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.490
I saw him just now.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.430
Hey!

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.740
Mr. Ramil.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.100
Mr. Ramil, are you okay?

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.720
The wound on your chest looks really bad.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.050
If I can’t take it anymore,

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.050
will you carry me?

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.340
Don’t joke, Mr. Ramil.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.060
I still don’t know where to take you next.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.900
Let’s get out of here.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.310
There’s a place in the forest.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.290
We’ll stay there.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.060
Mr. Ramil.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.569
Mr. Ramil.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.170
You seem to have a fever,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.540
but your body feels ice cold.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.910
I’m probably dying.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.280
No.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.870
I’m already dead.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.070
Don’t joke.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.070
I’m worried about you.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.900
I’m glad you’re worried about me.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.640
But I don’t like to see you in danger.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.380
These are the typical symptoms
of injured vampires.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.590
My body is cold because of the wound.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.500
But after that…

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.780
What happens next?

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.960
The fever will go down and I’ll recover.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.440
So that means I have to give you
a sponge bath to bring the fever down.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.170
Then you’ll recover, right?

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.380
No, you have to cuddle me all night
so I can recover.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.280
Now get well soon.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.980
I’ll recover as soon as I can.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.680
I thought you said if I cuddled you all night, you’d get better.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.970
But you seem worse.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.340
You tossed and turned last night.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.300
I couldn’t cuddle you tightly.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.220
Come, let me cuddle you again.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.970
You don’t seem to be getting better.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.180
I’m sorry, Mr. Ramil,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720
for being the cause of everything.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.370
Don’t blame yourself, Punn.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.410
We don’t know what caused this.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.730
But no matter what it is,

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.790
we’ll resolve it together.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.070
I’m thinking of going into the forest to see
if there’s any herb that can ease your pain.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.970
If you’re going into the forest,

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.920
please be careful.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.500
The Forest of Greenmoore
is no ordinary place.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.580
It’s a magical forest.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.760
It’s also where the woman who cursed
and trapped me inside the painting lives.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.890
She’s the Mother of Demons, Lilith.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.060
You shouldn’t touch other people’s stuff without permission.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.990
You don’t need to look for any herbs
in this forest.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.970
The Forest of Greenmoore doesn’t have
any plants that can cure a vampire’s fever.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.340
You know Mr. Ramil is injured.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.310
I see your future, Punn Winnala.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.680
You came here with him.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.200
I saw it coming.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.160
Can you cure Mr. Ramil?

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.170
Not me,

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.930
but his curse breaker, Punn Winnala.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.830
I’m only the spinner of the wheel of fate
between you and him.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:17.940
Nothing more.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.380
With the blood of his curse breaker
and the utterance of his name,

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.820
the curse that has bound him shall vanish.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.650
His curse breaker will be
the one he loves for eternity.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.700
Do you know why I told Ramil
how to break the curse?

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.670
Because he never had anyone
who loved him.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.580
He never loved anyone.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.900
When I cursed him, I knew

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.780
he’d never be able to break it.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.000
But then I saw you in my vision,

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.580
so…

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.700
I decided to put myself on the line
with him and you.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:15.890
Only the blood of someone a vampire loves can break any curse placed upon them.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.360
So, it might be possible to cure him.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.540
Would you like to prove it?

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.500
If it can save Mr. Ramil, I will try.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.680
In that case, let me give you a warning.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.980
An injured vampire might not be able
to control himself.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.880
If you want to prove the love
you have for each other,

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.140
you may have to struggle
to survive against his instincts.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.580
Thank you.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.800
The Greenmoore you’re in right now

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.770
is just a simulation inside
the painting I trapped Ramil in.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.850
Everything here is limitless.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.940
Time outside has no effect on this place.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.910
Here, everything is eternal.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.650
I see your future.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.550
This is just the beginning.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.360
But don’t worry. You two will pass this test.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.500
I wish you good luck, Punn Winnala.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.120
Thank you for setting me free.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.340
Punn, what happened?

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.280
Mr. Ramil!

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.460
Mr. Ramil!

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.380
Mr. Ramil, open the door!

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.480
Mr. Ramil, open the door and let me in!

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.090
No!

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.680
I don’t want to drink your blood.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.480
You have to let me in.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.460
I’m not afraid of you.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.300
No! No!

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.250
I can’t do it.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.450
If you come near me, you’ll be in danger.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.920
No, Mr. Ramil.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.940
Leave me here.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.750
Run far away!

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.200
No, Mr. Ramil.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.380
I’m not afraid of anything.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.380
You have to drink my blood.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.580
I can’t stop my thirst for blood.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.960
No, Mr. Ramil.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.820
I’m not leaving you!

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.500
Open the door for me!

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.900
I’m not leaving you!

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.290
Mr. Ramil!

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.180
Mr. Ramil!

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.180
No, Mr. Ramil! Let go!

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.700
Don’t, Mr. Ramil!

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.860
Get yourself together!

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.860
It’s me! Mr. Ramil!

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.970
Mr. Ramil!

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.330
Mr. Ramil!

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.280
Mr. Ramil!

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.900
Hey!

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:18.820
Mr. Ramil!

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.969
Mr. Ramil!

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:29.219
Mr. Ramil!

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.210
No matter what happens,

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.159
I’ll protect you.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.180
Mr. Ramil, don’t do that.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.100
Don’t come any closer!

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.170
Mr. Ramil.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.330
I’m here, Mr. Ramil.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.290
I’m not going anywhere.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.950
Punn.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.500
Punn!

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.130
Punn!

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.250
Punn!

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.430
Punn, stay with me!

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.140
Look at me, Punn!

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.550
Wake up! Don’t fall asleep!

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.860
I love you, Punn.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.580
I love you too, Mr. Ramil.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.250
Punn.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.260
I’m sorry.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.740
I couldn’t control myself
and ended up hurting you.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.330
It’s alright.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.360
Don’t feel guilty.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.620
I’m just glad you’re okay now.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.050
I’ve been waiting to hear those words
all along.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.100
What words?

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.920
That you love me.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.900
I love you, Mr. Ramil.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.900
Let’s get out of here.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.890
I don’t want to run away
from problems anymore.

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.790
I want to go back and face them.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.610
I want to make things right.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.460
And I want you, Mr. Ramil.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.620
Of course. I’ll go anywhere with you.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.370
Punn, no matter what happens from now on,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.560
I promise I won’t let go of your hand.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.400
I’ll stay by your side forever.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.990
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:45.860
Hey, Punn!

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:47.860
Oh?

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.740
Why did he leave the light on?

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.780
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed…)

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.560
What do you think you’re doing?

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.770
These vampires

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.370
are my family!

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.130
You’re my family too, Punn.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.500
I feel bad for being the reason you guys are fighting.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.590
We’ve talked about this.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.360
Pokpong hasn’t been home in a while.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.130
Have you called or contacted him at all?

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.070
Did Pokpong not come to work today?
