00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.552
Can you keep a secret, Victor?

00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:22.555
You can trust me.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.052
I'll run away to travel in Thailand.

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.258
Why do you always cause trouble, huh?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.247
I'll send you to your uncle
in the south for three months.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.797
If you know you get seasick,
take a motion sickness pill beforehand.

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:34.342
No free ride here.

00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:35.925
Even if you're my nephew,

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.177
you'll have to work.

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:38.671
Help! Someone's drowning.

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:40.378
You want me to take care of him?

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:41.609
Let him stay for now.

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:43.715
I'll name you… Wave.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:44.900
Ouch!

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.455
I'll hurry you up to remember who you are.

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:49.398
Then I'll finally be free of this burden.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.037
May I?
TWO WEEKS EARLIER

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:52.942
TWO WEEKS EARLIER

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:56.710
Excuse me.

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:58.020
May I ask you something?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.680
Of course.

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:02.698
Is it true that
there's a party on the island tonight?

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.322
Every full moon,
there's a party that goes on until dawn.

00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:06.645
There's also a fireworks show.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:07.773
Very beautiful.

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:09.142
Really?

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.227
I'd love to see the fireworks.

00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:13.271
You can watch from the hotel's front beach.

00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:14.429
But for the best view,

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.466
I recommend paddling out
to the middle of the sea.

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.190
It's not far, and the vibes are super romantic.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.879
Sure.

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:22.944
I'd like to go.

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:25.404
I can arrange a boat for you, sir.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:26.493
Perfect.

00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:29.750
I don't know when
I'll get a chance like this again.

00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:30.822
Are you sure?

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:33.200
The ocean at night can be frightening.

00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:34.826
I want to.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.034
No one can object to you anyway.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.685
Let's do as he said.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.225
Hey.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.564
Nothing's gonna come out
and bite me, right?

00:01:57.053 --> 00:01:57.953
No.

00:01:58.442 --> 00:01:59.730
And if something does, I'll chase it away.

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:05.036
Having time to myself like this…

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:06.917
it's pretty great.

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:13.326
It makes me realize… where I belong.

00:02:16.748 --> 00:02:21.072
But you still have to go back to
being the prince of Arantha.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.114
I know.

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:29.065
But sometimes I wonder…

00:02:30.263 --> 00:02:32.220
If I could live a different life,

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:35.789
to experience love like ordinary people do—

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:39.627
a love I don't have to hide,

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:44.286
free from duty or family expectations,

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:47.748
a love where I can hold someone's hand

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.904
without caring what others might think…

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:54.540
would that ever be possible?

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.427
Of course, it's possible.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.707
You don't have to cheer me up.

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:08.573
I know…

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:12.005
I have to return to reality.

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.094
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:29.436
Thank you for bringing me this far.

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:32.768
Ahem!

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:37.580
Wake up.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.083
Get up.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.007
I said get up. Up!

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.774
Why didn't you knock
before entering the room?

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:49.315
This is my room.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.605
Well, most of what's in here
barely belongs to me now.

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:53.062
You took my bed.

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:54.582
You took my clothes.

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:57.543
When your memories come back,
I expect back pay.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:04:58.782
Are you done talking?

00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:00.645
I will rest.

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:03.649
Get up! Don't.

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:05.365
Go shower and change.

00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:08.114
I've got a whole day planned.

00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:16.149
I don't wear unwashed clothes.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.683
Bring me fresh ones.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.275
I'm not your servant.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.600
Can't you at least help, though?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.633
Underwear as well.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.884
Just turn it inside out.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.752
Unhygienic.

00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:26.304
Then don't wear any.

00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:26.804
Hey.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.477
I'm not leaving the house without underwear.

00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.420
Are they new?

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:37.711
They're mine.

00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:41.279
I don't share underwear.

00:05:42.501 --> 00:05:44.009
Who knows what they've been through?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.425
Then just go commando
and let your balls scratch your thighs.

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:03.207
Hey!

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.483
Wave!

00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:05.721
Wave!

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.918
What the heck are you doing?

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:11.108
MARY JANE

00:06:11.646 --> 00:06:12.645
Mary Jane?

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.307
Using or selling?

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:17.676
Don't you have better clothes?

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:21.028
What did you pick for me?

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:22.585
You have no taste.

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:23.837
It suits you fine.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.598
What were you doing anyway?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.155
You took all the time in the world.

00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:28.274
Get in.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.244
Why don't you move?

00:06:35.393 --> 00:06:36.541
Open the door for me.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.294
Do I have to roll out a red carpet too?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.105
Fine, I will just carry you.

00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:41.820
Don't.

00:06:44.094 --> 00:06:45.403
I don't like being touched.

00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:01.691
That's it.

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:02.864
Roll up the window.

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:34.960
Can you do anything yourself at all?

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.569
Are you always such a fussy person?

00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.459
I became one once you moved in.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.588
Are these clothes even clean?

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:15.784
What the hell are you saying?

00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:18.130
The shop owner will smack you for that.

00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:21.074
Well, it's true.

00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:23.927
They smell musty. They might have germs.

00:08:25.223 --> 00:08:26.323
You don't know anything.

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:28.583
It's called a ‘vintage' smell.

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:30.937
These have value, you know?

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:34.407
Each piece has a story.

00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:36.946
They have history.

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:39.679
Most of them came from dead bodies.

00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:43.393
Really?

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:48.882
The one you're holding still has blood stains.

00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:51.822
The former owner was a nightclub musician.

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:53.922
He was riding a bike to pick up his lover.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.758
But then he got hit by a ten-wheeler. Bang!

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.362
Dead on the spot.

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:09.169
As for this one,

00:09:10.074 --> 00:09:11.740
the former owner was a handsome guy.

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:13.983
He's on his way to surprise his lover.

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:16.696
While he was running there,

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.321
a heart attack hit.

00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:21.336
Thump, thump, thump.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.415
Dead on the spot.

00:09:23.882 --> 00:09:27.155
His hand was still clutching the shirt.

00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:30.830
I don't believe in ghosts.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.030
Don't fool me.

00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:36.545
It won't hurt to believe.

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:37.610
Careful.

00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:39.717
Slip it on,

00:09:40.548 --> 00:09:41.977
and the owner might come looking for it.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:42.781
Brr!

00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:48.658
Bro.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.633
Watch your mouth,

00:09:50.877 --> 00:09:52.693
or you will become a ghost yourself.

00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:54.571
I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:57.969 --> 00:09:59.128
Goodbye.

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:04.571
I want this one.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:07.770
It's firsthand.

00:10:08.112 --> 00:10:09.252
We don't have enough money.

00:10:10.474 --> 00:10:11.745
But I want this one.

00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:14.025
Uncle Peng gave us a limited budget.

00:10:14.318 --> 00:10:16.036
Pick from these secondhand racks.

00:10:16.452 --> 00:10:17.552
You will get plenty.

00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:22.593
Didn't you just say
those clothes are haunted?

00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:24.832
I want new clothes,

00:10:25.272 --> 00:10:26.897
so I won't be haunted.

00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:28.749
Think you're smart, huh?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.680
Fine.

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:32.342
I'll advance it.

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:35.310
But you have to work to pay me back.

00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:37.580
No using your amnesia as an excuse.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.618
You've got hands and feet.

00:10:39.327 --> 00:10:39.924
Fine.

00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:42.323
Then we'll shop more.

00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:45.863
I don't know how long I have to stay here.

00:10:47.183 --> 00:10:48.947
I'll work to pay you off later.

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:52.013
I'll take this one, this one, and this one.

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:53.188
This one, too.

00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:55.064
Hey, easy there. Wait, wait.

00:10:55.064 --> 00:10:56.123
This one looks nice too.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.111
I'm buying it.

00:10:57.307 --> 00:10:58.680
You're shopping like a billionaire's kid.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.815
Don't forget to pay.

00:11:08.078 --> 00:11:08.881
Thank you.

00:11:32.435 --> 00:11:36.507
I'd like everyone to be careful
and check for Influenza A.

00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:38.155
It's spreading widely right now.

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:40.456
You'll each receive a leaflet.

00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:42.712
Please check yourself.

00:11:43.812 --> 00:11:45.043
How's your sore throat?

00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:45.991
It's better now.

00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:46.742
It is?

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:48.504
Did you take the medicine I prescribed?

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.408
I did.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:50.219
Great.

00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:52.129
Take precautions, okay?

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:53.136
The flu is spreading.

00:11:53.332 --> 00:11:54.366
I'm thinking about getting an injection.

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:55.462
Come get one with me.

00:11:55.462 --> 00:11:55.981
Sure.

00:11:57.325 --> 00:11:58.116
Here, Doctor.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.644
Let me help.

00:12:04.998 --> 00:12:06.038
Did you hand them all out?

00:12:07.554 --> 00:12:08.807
Have you got the document?

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.070
Have you got one?

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.870
Here you go.

00:12:24.426 --> 00:12:25.236
Doctor Wut,

00:12:25.823 --> 00:12:27.276
would you like to join us for a meal?

00:12:27.423 --> 00:12:29.566
We're having Som Tum afterward.

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:31.978
I think I'll pass.

00:12:31.978 --> 00:12:34.165
After I'm done here,
I've got something else to do.

00:12:34.849 --> 00:12:35.505
Okay then.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.071
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.

00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:38.864
See you.

00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:40.293
Let's go.

00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:41.940
I'm starving.

00:12:57.938 --> 00:12:59.363
My boyfriend is amazing.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.547
Are you tired today?

00:13:02.332 --> 00:13:03.878
Not too tired.

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:06.877
I just wanted people to listen
and follow my suggestions.

00:13:08.344 --> 00:13:09.676
Don't you have work to do?

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.092
Work can wait.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.110
Guarding my boyfriend is more important.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.008
You're cute and smart. I'm possessive.

00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:20.242
If anyone tries to hit on you,

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:21.798
they'll end up as shark food.

00:13:21.798 --> 00:13:22.992
Oh, please.

00:13:24.214 --> 00:13:26.200
You don't have to do that much.

00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:29.695
Dating like normal people is enough for me.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:31.184
There.

00:13:31.917 --> 00:13:32.945
You said that again.

00:13:33.874 --> 00:13:35.411
Well, we could get married now.

00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:37.416
No one would even criticize.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.666
You're the only one holding out.

00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:46.064
From what you said,

00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:47.671
do you want me to
go ask your parents already?

00:13:48.893 --> 00:13:50.886
Will the dowry be high?

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.767
I'm smart. Of course it'll be high.

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:57.483
No matter how high, I can pay.

00:13:58.412 --> 00:13:59.665
Are you ready to get married?

00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:01.559
Should we do it? Hm?

00:14:02.072 --> 00:14:03.091
Can you really pay?

00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:03.728
Mm.

00:14:03.728 --> 00:14:04.874
Just carry these for me.

00:14:07.856 --> 00:14:09.194
Hey, Doc. They're heavy.

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.019
Come. We still have work to do.

00:14:14.148 --> 00:14:15.915
The laundry machine is over there.

00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:19.885
Wash clothes, towels, and bedsheets.

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:22.515
How do you use it?

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:24.285
Just read the instructions.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.480
Gosh, how will you earn a living
with skills like yours?

00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:37.917
Do I have to wash your underwear?

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.044
Yeah.

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:41.353
Why? Are you disgusted?

00:14:41.353 --> 00:14:42.196
It's something you've got too.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.620
Well…

00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:48.549
You should wash your own.

00:14:48.696 --> 00:14:50.510
Underwear is personal.

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:54.000
I'm too lazy. That's why I hired you.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.291
I ran out of clean underwear.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.385
Right now, I feel so airy down there.

00:14:57.385 --> 00:14:58.320
How comfortable.

00:15:16.164 --> 00:15:17.499
By the way,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.630
underwear should be hand-washed.

00:15:19.997 --> 00:15:21.806
Machine-washing will stretch the waistband.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.960
There aren't many choices in labor work.

00:15:26.302 --> 00:15:27.550
You should learn that.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.596
Yippee!

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.366
Did you wash it by hand
or with a jackhammer?

00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:14.801
I saw your underwear was dirty,

00:16:15.388 --> 00:16:18.277
so I kindly scrubbed it with a brush for you.

00:16:19.084 --> 00:16:20.007
Sorry, though.

00:16:20.154 --> 00:16:22.091
I couldn't control the scrubbing speed.

00:16:25.073 --> 00:16:27.149
And why are my shirts all dyed like this?

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.517
Didn't you separate whites from colors?

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:31.890
Did I have to?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.245
I didn't know that.

00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:36.638
Thought it was fine to wash them together.

00:16:36.858 --> 00:16:39.276
Home Economics 101,
didn't you attend this class?

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.153
I'm sorry.

00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:43.176
I've never been a laborer before.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.801
What a waste.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.749
Hey!

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:57.334
The barnacles have been there
for a hundred years.

00:16:57.334 --> 00:16:58.741
Use some energy.

00:17:01.748 --> 00:17:03.054
Gosh, you're so fragile.

00:17:03.175 --> 00:17:04.451
Give it here. I'll do it.

00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:07.419
Damn it. You're useless.

00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:10.671
See? How hard can it be, Wave?

00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:13.069
See? Look.

00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:14.846
See?

00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:15.616
Do you get it?

00:17:15.616 --> 00:17:17.489
Just scrape, scrape, scrape.

00:17:18.882 --> 00:17:20.151
Can't you do it?

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.369
It's not hard at all.

00:17:26.865 --> 00:17:27.419
Gosh.

00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:30.920
Scrub the boat with a sponge.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:39.082
Come on, why so slow?

00:17:39.962 --> 00:17:42.623
Do it quickly. Be more active than this.

00:17:49.242 --> 00:17:50.832
Do you even know how to do anything at all?

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.258
Let go.

00:17:58.292 --> 00:17:59.412
This is so easy.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.059
Is it too hard to get? Just wipe left, then right.

00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:05.498
Left, right, left, right.

00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:06.911
Who are you exactly?

00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:08.790
You can't even do something this simple.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.266
What are you going to do in life?

00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:12.355
How useless of you.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.599
Hey!

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.438
Sorry.

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:28.160
My mistake.

00:18:30.947 --> 00:18:33.681
Gosh. What the hell?

00:18:59.127 --> 00:19:00.035
Hey!

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.051
That's marijuana.

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:04.190
It's a drug.

00:19:07.265 --> 00:19:08.694
It's not a drug.

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:10.050
It's just an herb.

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.303
It's bad for your health anyway.

00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:16.548
And I'll damage your brain.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.459
You know it all, huh?

00:19:21.837 --> 00:19:22.619
What are you, a doctor?

00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:29.909
And don't tell Uncle Peng I smoke weed.

00:19:30.748 --> 00:19:33.452
If you do, you're dead.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.013
Just go on with the housework.

00:19:41.124 --> 00:19:42.789
Ugh! It stinks.

00:21:22.046 --> 00:21:22.706
Wave!

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:30.417
Wave!

00:21:30.517 --> 00:21:32.739
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

00:21:34.656 --> 00:21:37.009
This is Uncle Peng's collectible.

00:21:39.784 --> 00:21:41.446
Can I buy him a new one?

00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:43.486
Where would you get the money?

00:21:44.964 --> 00:21:46.572
From the work I do for you.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.068
Work?

00:21:48.068 --> 00:21:49.550
You can't even do laundry properly,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.700
and now you broke this vase.

00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:51.982
No money for you.

00:21:52.701 --> 00:21:55.103
Hey, it's not fair.

00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:59.082
People like you
are the cause of labor problems.

00:21:59.781 --> 00:22:01.360
You're a terrible employer.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.583
You made me work for free. It's exploitation.

00:22:02.843 --> 00:22:04.170
When did I ever exploit you?

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.582
You dropped this yourself.

00:22:05.961 --> 00:22:07.476
Why weren't you careful while cleaning?

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.116
I will tell Uncle Peng.

00:22:09.116 --> 00:22:09.959
Go ahead.

00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:13.291
He'll roast you for breaking his vase.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.613
Then I'll just say I'm sick.

00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:19.856
Uncle Peng is reasonable.

00:22:20.295 --> 00:22:21.257
He should forgive me.

00:22:22.694 --> 00:22:25.308
And I'll tell him you smoke marijuana.

00:22:26.526 --> 00:22:28.458
While I was doing housework,

00:22:28.977 --> 00:22:30.960
you were doing drugs.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.414
It's an herb.

00:22:32.733 --> 00:22:33.262
Yeah?

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.661
But I don't think Uncle Peng will buy that.

00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:40.496
He'll think you're so high

00:22:40.616 --> 00:22:42.080
you've lost your senses.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.160
You want a problem with me?

00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:54.846
I won't put up with you anymore.

00:22:55.565 --> 00:22:57.251
I'm going back to Bangkok.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.508
It should be better than
taking care of an amnesia patient like you.

00:23:45.636 --> 00:23:46.509
Where are you going?

00:23:46.948 --> 00:23:47.956
Back to Bangkok.

00:23:48.236 --> 00:23:48.990
You can't.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.497
I command you to stay here.

00:23:50.497 --> 00:23:52.480
Who are you, my parents?

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.759
Or my wife?

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.381
Move, or I'll miss my boat.

00:23:56.621 --> 00:23:57.286
No.

00:23:59.462 --> 00:23:59.976
Move.

00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:00.715
No.

00:24:01.114 --> 00:24:02.497
Move! Wave!

00:24:02.497 --> 00:24:03.071
Shit.

00:24:05.347 --> 00:24:06.579
My phone!

00:24:08.895 --> 00:24:09.709
Go get it back.

00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:10.424
No.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.471
Go.

00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:12.224
No.

00:24:12.464 --> 00:24:13.710
Who told you to run away from me?

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.160
You dropped it, so you have to pick it up.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.947
I'm not doing it.

00:24:16.127 --> 00:24:18.003
It's your stuff. Do it yourself.

00:24:18.003 --> 00:24:19.040
I don't want to get wet.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.916
I told you to jump.

00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:20.575
No.

00:24:20.575 --> 00:24:21.075
Jump!

00:24:21.075 --> 00:24:21.575
No!

00:24:21.575 --> 00:24:22.163
Fine. You won't jump?

00:24:22.482 --> 00:24:22.982
So what?

00:24:22.982 --> 00:24:23.613
You won't jump?

00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:24.460
Hey!

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:25.686
You!

00:24:25.846 --> 00:24:28.525
I'm gonna show you what I'm capable of.

00:24:28.964 --> 00:24:29.636
No!

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.235
Get my phone.

00:24:34.534 --> 00:24:36.776
If you don't, I'll push you back down.

00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:00.269
Don't stall.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.508
No tricks. Give it.

00:25:06.363 --> 00:25:07.551
Give me that, damn it.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.548
Shit!

00:25:12.601 --> 00:25:13.437
Wave!

00:25:14.236 --> 00:25:15.382
How do I go home now?

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.521
I told you, you can't leave.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.512
My order is final.

00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.581
So defiant, aren't you?

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.334
Huh?

00:25:34.572 --> 00:25:36.015
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:25:45.829 --> 00:25:47.249
I want to go back to Bangkok, Uncle.

00:25:48.048 --> 00:25:49.245
I don't want to be here.

00:25:50.303 --> 00:25:52.380
What were you thinking, making me
take care of someone with no memory?

00:25:54.297 --> 00:25:58.074
I knew you wouldn't last long,
just like your mom predicted.

00:25:58.753 --> 00:26:02.246
Tum and I even made a bet on
whether you'd last more than a month here.

00:26:03.184 --> 00:26:04.157
What did Mom say?

00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:07.554
Your mom is still hopeful.

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.499
She wants you to do better,

00:26:09.499 --> 00:26:10.851
to not cause problems.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.398
But from the first week you got here,

00:26:13.698 --> 00:26:15.282
I knew you couldn't bear it.

00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:19.090
Sorry for trusting Wave with you.

00:26:20.128 --> 00:26:22.073
You can't even take care of yourself.

00:26:22.972 --> 00:26:24.202
You can't take care of anyone.

00:26:24.841 --> 00:26:26.470
You can't go back to your own house.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.091
You have to crash at your friend's.

00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:33.696
Didn't you run away
from my grandparents' house too?

00:26:38.288 --> 00:26:41.359
When you've made it big like me,
then you can talk back.

00:26:45.233 --> 00:26:46.782
You can let him go, Uncle Peng.

00:26:47.681 --> 00:26:49.279
I can go back to the hospital.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.390
Don't, Wave.

00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:51.633
You stay.

00:26:52.252 --> 00:26:53.795
If anyone wants to leave, let them.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.573
I'll look after you until you find your relatives.

00:26:57.012 --> 00:26:59.605
Someone like me
doesn't abandon things halfway.

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:01.339
If I help, I help all the way through.

00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:05.319
We shouldn't have been born
if we can't help others.

00:27:11.309 --> 00:27:13.556
You're nothing like your dad.

00:27:15.752 --> 00:27:17.262
Why would you mention my dad?

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.917
Because your dad was kind.

00:27:21.177 --> 00:27:22.599
He loved helping people.

00:27:24.077 --> 00:27:27.162
I just don't see any of that in you.

00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:33.479
Come on, I'll drop you off.

00:27:34.697 --> 00:27:37.859
Wave, get his suitcase.

00:27:38.438 --> 00:27:40.363
Repay him for saving your life.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.917
Don't.

00:27:57.248 --> 00:27:59.068
I know you're only saying that
to give me a nudge.

00:28:23.244 --> 00:28:24.369
Wow!

00:28:24.728 --> 00:28:26.256
The ride is awesome, Dad.

00:28:27.614 --> 00:28:32.200
And one day, it will be yours.

00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:34.826
Ride it with someone you like.

00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:36.923
It's so romantic.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.183
Roger that.

00:28:38.962 --> 00:28:40.063
If I have someone,

00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:41.411
I will come take this bike immediately.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.296
Look.

00:28:45.912 --> 00:28:46.676
My baby.

00:29:02.527 --> 00:29:03.231
Hey.

00:29:06.466 --> 00:29:09.816
I'm sorry for breaking your phone.

00:29:12.112 --> 00:29:12.814
It's fine.

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:14.936
I have a way to get a new one.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.424
I don't want to be a burden.

00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:28.329
I'll find evidence as quickly as I can.

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:30.038
Yeah.

00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:36.245
Can you take me to
the beach where you found me?

00:29:37.683 --> 00:29:39.014
It might help me remember something.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.392
Fine.

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:49.527
Thank you.

00:29:52.103 --> 00:29:53.539
Yes, I know.

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:05.924
Where's your father now?

00:30:07.621 --> 00:30:09.363
Not knowing this won't kill you.

00:30:12.857 --> 00:30:14.404
I just want to know

00:30:16.121 --> 00:30:17.478
because you were furious at Uncle Peng.

00:30:17.478 --> 00:30:18.688
My dad is dead.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.267
Are we done?

00:31:14.462 --> 00:31:15.811
Here. You lay right here.

00:31:17.181 --> 00:31:18.156
How?

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.595
Like this.

00:31:24.913 --> 00:31:26.466
Can you get down and demonstrate?

00:31:26.881 --> 00:31:28.657
I want to know the position I was lying in.

00:31:29.396 --> 00:31:30.821
What the heck?

00:31:31.434 --> 00:31:35.077
If I see it, it might jog my memory.

00:31:36.537 --> 00:31:37.243
Gosh.

00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:43.329
You were lying like this.

00:31:45.457 --> 00:31:46.551
What happened next?

00:31:48.462 --> 00:31:50.135
I was swimming and saw you,

00:31:50.135 --> 00:31:51.745
so I dragged you back to shore.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.165
What next?

00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:54.952
And I saved your damn life.

00:31:56.899 --> 00:31:57.606
How?

00:31:59.445 --> 00:32:00.007
Ow.

00:32:02.098 --> 00:32:02.968
What are you doing?

00:32:03.653 --> 00:32:04.957
Demonstrating.

00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:07.619
Here comes some great content.

00:32:09.548 --> 00:32:11.619
I pressed your chest to get the water out.

00:32:14.378 --> 00:32:15.629
But you wouldn't wake up.

00:32:18.874 --> 00:32:19.749
Then…

00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:21.982
I sucked your mouth.

00:32:25.948 --> 00:32:27.615
Geez! That's enough.

00:32:29.382 --> 00:32:32.440
I think I remember something.

00:32:36.515 --> 00:32:38.979
Did I have anything with me?

00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:43.925
Not a single thing.

00:32:47.441 --> 00:32:49.537
I posted your photo on social media.

00:32:49.726 --> 00:32:50.813
No one knows you.

00:32:51.823 --> 00:32:52.657
Don't stress.

00:32:52.982 --> 00:32:54.326
Maybe I just don't have many followers.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.946
You don't have to push so hard.

00:32:58.253 --> 00:32:59.276
Just let your life be.

00:33:00.232 --> 00:33:03.139
We need to go help Uncle Peng
pick up some trash on the beach.

00:33:03.283 --> 00:33:05.855
As for you, we'll figure out
another way to help later.

00:33:07.586 --> 00:33:08.255
Now, get up.

00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:11.649
Will you really help me?

00:33:13.849 --> 00:33:17.521
At this point, no one wants you
to remember more than I do.

00:33:21.361 --> 00:33:21.872
Quick!

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.179
Ow.

00:33:27.792 --> 00:33:28.805
Oops.

00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:29.937
Here we go again.

00:33:33.597 --> 00:33:35.491
What the heck are you doing?

00:33:36.933 --> 00:33:37.671
Go, Tum.

00:33:38.032 --> 00:33:38.700
Come on.

00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:40.393
That was great, my friend.

00:33:41.835 --> 00:33:42.670
It's super nice.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.059
Mr. Peng, do the locals always
have to clean up after the party?

00:33:54.267 --> 00:33:54.971
Yes.

00:33:55.404 --> 00:33:57.378
Some tourists help too.

00:33:58.514 --> 00:34:01.300
But shouldn't the partygoers
clean up after themselves?

00:34:03.428 --> 00:34:04.917
I wish it could be like that too.

00:34:05.602 --> 00:34:10.311
But the tourists bring in income for the locals.

00:34:10.509 --> 00:34:12.207
We have to keep the beach clean

00:34:12.532 --> 00:34:14.025
so it stays a tourist attraction
for years to come.

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:15.613
Yes, sir.

00:34:31.963 --> 00:34:32.620
Let me help.

00:34:33.125 --> 00:34:33.857
Can you stand up?

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:37.248
Walk slowly.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.717
Doing off-site medical service today?

00:34:48.015 --> 00:34:49.547
I came to help people pick up trash.

00:34:49.944 --> 00:34:51.055
But I saw him lying on the beach for so long.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.496
I was afraid the tide'd carry him out to sea.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.522
I hate irresponsible drunk people.

00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:03.224
What are you like when you're drunk, Chief?

00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:07.356
Clingy.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.341
Should we meet at the same spot tonight?

00:35:20.765 --> 00:35:21.769
Is there a reason?

00:35:23.716 --> 00:35:26.611
Yes, but I can't tell you now.

00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:28.484
Yeah?

00:35:31.964 --> 00:35:32.679
Peng.

00:35:36.736 --> 00:35:37.556
Hello, Principal.

00:35:37.556 --> 00:35:38.602
Hello.

00:35:39.161 --> 00:35:40.650
I'd like to talk to you.

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.333
It's about the school.

00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:43.668
Do you have time?

00:35:44.263 --> 00:35:45.589
Were you two discussing something?

00:35:46.436 --> 00:35:47.136
Nothing.

00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:48.378
You can talk to him, Dad.

00:35:49.027 --> 00:35:50.036
Come on then.

00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:50.893
Come.

00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:02.368
Damn, so much garbage.

00:36:04.153 --> 00:36:04.883
Hey, dude.

00:36:05.298 --> 00:36:05.883
What?

00:36:05.883 --> 00:36:07.835
I think Wave is not so bad.

00:36:08.214 --> 00:36:09.585
You should be nicer to him.

00:36:09.946 --> 00:36:11.708
He doesn't seem evil.

00:36:12.213 --> 00:36:13.285
He even loves children.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.266
If you had to deal with his prince-like habits
the way I do, you'd understand.

00:36:17.266 --> 00:36:19.869
He's supposed to make life easier,
but he just adds more burden.

00:36:19.995 --> 00:36:20.678
Are you mad or something?

00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:21.723
I'm not.

00:36:22.534 --> 00:36:23.247
Chill, dude.

00:36:23.517 --> 00:36:25.362
I'll take you to Honey's bar tonight.

00:36:25.362 --> 00:36:26.245
I'm telling you…

00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:29.519
it's the highlight of this island.

00:36:29.726 --> 00:36:30.620
Nice.

00:36:30.782 --> 00:36:32.237
That just makes me want to stay longer.

00:36:33.265 --> 00:36:34.221
You'll see.

00:36:34.636 --> 00:36:35.380
It's dope.

00:36:36.426 --> 00:36:38.558
Hi, girlfriend.

00:36:38.648 --> 00:36:40.824
Here, let me help you with that.

00:36:42.862 --> 00:36:45.112
You guys just talk and don't actually work.

00:36:46.013 --> 00:36:47.884
We're helping here.

00:36:47.884 --> 00:36:48.787
Stop nagging.

00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:51.831
People set up a good activity for you.

00:36:51.831 --> 00:36:54.432
Do it, or nothing you do in your life is good.

00:36:54.432 --> 00:36:56.159
You scold me so much.

00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:57.549
Careful. One day, you might end up with me.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.984
They should pick you up too,

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.229
since you're trash as well.

00:37:01.229 --> 00:37:04.866
But trash like me
can always be recycled and reused.

00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:06.853
Gosh.

00:37:07.105 --> 00:37:09.739
Kratae, do you want to join us
at Honey's Bar tonight?

00:37:10.406 --> 00:37:11.873
I'm taking Lava to check it out.

00:37:14.812 --> 00:37:16.501
You're smoking weed again, aren't you?

00:37:16.735 --> 00:37:21.291
Tum, don't lead him into bad stuff.

00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:23.034
He'll turn bad because of you.

00:37:23.034 --> 00:37:24.513
Ouch! My nipple!

00:37:24.513 --> 00:37:25.330
No.

00:37:25.871 --> 00:37:28.500
If I'm going to go bad, it's on me, not him.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.305
Hey, well said, dude.

00:37:30.305 --> 00:37:31.956
You're both hopeless.

00:37:32.046 --> 00:37:36.504
I just hope you don't make Wave bad too.

00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:38.681
How do you know he's not already bad?

00:37:39.853 --> 00:37:40.562
Wave.

00:37:41.752 --> 00:37:43.555
Wave, Wave.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.289
Tonight, Tum and Lava are going to
smoke weed at Honey's bar.

00:37:47.433 --> 00:37:49.457
Don't go with them, okay?

00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:54.581
Let's go, let's go.

00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:56.525
Hurry before Wave catches up.

00:37:58.869 --> 00:37:59.369
Oh, shit.

00:37:59.369 --> 00:38:01.555
Lava, where are you going?

00:38:02.691 --> 00:38:03.263
Wave.

00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:05.251
I'm running an errand.

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:06.956
You can go home with Uncle Peng.

00:38:07.713 --> 00:38:08.497
What errand?

00:38:09.435 --> 00:38:11.742
I know you're going to do drugs.

00:38:12.986 --> 00:38:14.160
Kratae told me everything.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.197
Hey, it's not a drug.

00:38:16.467 --> 00:38:17.535
It's an herb.

00:38:18.545 --> 00:38:19.459
Then I'm coming with you.

00:38:19.726 --> 00:38:20.788
You can't.

00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:23.310
It's not a place for you. You won't like it.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.725
I can just sit and do nothing.

00:38:25.013 --> 00:38:26.365
I don't want to stay home alone.

00:38:26.365 --> 00:38:28.747
Don't act like a lover
guarding their love at a bar.

00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:29.781
Don't go.

00:38:30.142 --> 00:38:31.685
Just let him come.

00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:32.926
Let him open his eyes a little.

00:38:33.486 --> 00:38:36.520
I just want to have fun
with no one in my way, got it?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.362
I get it.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.089
If you don't let me come,

00:38:43.856 --> 00:38:45.389
I'll just have to warm up my voice a little.

00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:47.091
Ahem.

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:50.955
Uncle Peng, Uncle Peng.

00:38:51.063 --> 00:38:52.422
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:38:56.839 --> 00:38:57.785
Fine, you can come.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.854
Okay.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.983
Come on. Time to go.

00:39:21.163 --> 00:39:21.824
Let's go.

00:39:29.812 --> 00:39:30.520
What?

00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:32.724
Tum, what's wrong with the truck?

00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:34.940
It won't start.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.147
No! It can't be broken now.

00:39:37.147 --> 00:39:38.398
This is unbelievable!

00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:39.438
We must push it.

00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:41.440
Wave, help me push it.

00:39:43.531 --> 00:39:46.092
Wave, help me here. I can't do it alone.

00:39:48.292 --> 00:39:48.982
Quickly.

00:39:50.244 --> 00:39:52.938
Now. One, two, three.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.305
Push, push, push.

00:39:57.305 --> 00:39:58.309
Tum, start the engine.

00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:59.036
Go.

00:40:01.218 --> 00:40:03.017
It's starting now.

00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:05.203
Wave, what's that in the back?

00:40:07.222 --> 00:40:08.689
Woo-hoo!

00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:11.151
See you. Bye.

00:40:11.223 --> 00:40:11.954
Hey!

00:40:12.152 --> 00:40:13.042
Wait for me!

00:40:46.566 --> 00:40:47.166
Jeez.

00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:11.840
Can you please help me with something?

00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:13.408
Sure.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.205
This is heaven, sis.

00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:31.876
Besides me,

00:41:32.268 --> 00:41:35.086
you're the other highlight of this island.

00:41:35.773 --> 00:41:36.763
Sweet talker.

00:41:38.798 --> 00:41:40.358
You've got good stuff.

00:41:40.358 --> 00:41:41.885
I can help you sell it.

00:41:42.866 --> 00:41:44.463
Damn, this guy.

00:41:44.463 --> 00:41:45.669
You just got here.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.980
Are you becoming a dealer now?

00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:50.523
I need money.

00:41:50.989 --> 00:41:52.150
I have to buy back my bike.

00:41:57.946 --> 00:41:59.073
Nice move.

00:41:59.073 --> 00:42:00.714
Everything about me is nice.

00:42:01.376 --> 00:42:03.272
People in the back, have fun and be free.

00:42:04.082 --> 00:42:06.000
Honey is right here.

00:42:06.237 --> 00:42:08.047
Honey is right here!

00:42:08.537 --> 00:42:10.096
Woo!

00:42:13.382 --> 00:42:14.063
Wave.

00:42:14.774 --> 00:42:15.719
How did you get here?

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:17.451
You can never run away from me.

00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:19.421
Why did you follow me?

00:42:19.421 --> 00:42:20.462
You tricked me.

00:42:21.786 --> 00:42:23.724
It's not your kind of place. You won't like it.

00:42:24.337 --> 00:42:25.580
You don't know me.

00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.766
How can you tell what I like or don't like?

00:42:28.766 --> 00:42:30.271
No one knows you.

00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:32.012
Even you don't know yourself.

00:42:37.777 --> 00:42:43.831
Is he the one they said stranded
on the beach and lost his memories?

00:42:43.954 --> 00:42:45.089
That's right, sis.

00:42:45.383 --> 00:42:46.233
It's him.

00:42:53.886 --> 00:42:54.638
Wanna try it?

00:42:58.317 --> 00:43:00.646
No. I don't do drugs.

00:43:00.646 --> 00:43:01.233
Hey!

00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:04.745
This isn't drugs.

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.764
It's herbal.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.010
If you take it,

00:43:10.231 --> 00:43:13.043
you might remember something.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:14.969
Don't challenge him.

00:43:15.312 --> 00:43:18.112
This one's a chicken.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.729
It helps nourish your brain

00:43:28.729 --> 00:43:30.686
and boost performance.

00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:33.493
Interested?

00:43:34.474 --> 00:43:36.122
Will it really help?

00:43:38.526 --> 00:43:41.153
Can't you tell from looking at my face
if it helps?

00:43:44.646 --> 00:43:46.628
You don't try…

00:43:48.553 --> 00:43:49.624
you don't know.

00:43:52.812 --> 00:43:53.559
Here.

00:43:54.785 --> 00:43:56.139
Take it from my hand.

00:43:56.139 --> 00:43:58.027
So, yes or no?

00:44:00.652 --> 00:44:02.186
That's a yes.

00:44:07.115 --> 00:44:07.996
Go on.

00:44:16.727 --> 00:44:17.851
Aw.

00:44:18.205 --> 00:44:21.770
He's new. Don't blame him.

00:44:22.015 --> 00:44:23.620
It's alright.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.437
Let's continue the fun.

00:44:26.124 --> 00:44:28.327
Let's go. Come on.

00:44:28.817 --> 00:44:29.944
Hi, girls.

00:44:29.944 --> 00:44:31.121
Honey is coming.

00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:35.655
I told you not to come.

00:44:36.268 --> 00:44:37.844
Go full-on.

00:44:39.978 --> 00:44:43.626
Woo-hoo!

00:45:09.322 --> 00:45:10.968
Where's Lava?

00:45:12.486 --> 00:45:13.841
Out with Tum.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.751
He took Wave too.

00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:17.005
I don't know where they are.

00:45:20.046 --> 00:45:22.475
I'm still puzzled as to
why his mom sent him here

00:45:22.818 --> 00:45:25.951
when she barely talks to me

00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:27.854
because I'm like this.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.821
Maybe she sees the good in you.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.646
She might think you can help
her son become a better person.

00:45:38.957 --> 00:45:42.295
Or maybe she despises him so much
she doesn't want to deal with him.

00:45:44.134 --> 00:45:45.804
Maybe not that bad.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.250
Is that why you're hesitant
to admit you're with me?

00:45:57.694 --> 00:45:58.535
I don't know.

00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:04.114
I just feel like I'm not successful enough
to make people accept me.

00:46:13.213 --> 00:46:15.722
You're Chief. What are you afraid of?

00:46:15.992 --> 00:46:16.609
Hm?

00:46:20.435 --> 00:46:24.077
You know I'm not exactly a chief.

00:46:25.622 --> 00:46:28.309
I'm not successful. I'm not rich.

00:46:28.873 --> 00:46:30.989
People just call me that
because Tum started it.

00:46:33.638 --> 00:46:35.446
I think it's cool.

00:46:36.255 --> 00:46:37.882
This chief is from Bangkok.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.662
Only a few years on the island
and you could buy this whole resort.

00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:45.190
That's the coolest thing.

00:46:57.238 --> 00:46:58.466
Oh, boy.

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:01.040
Look at him.

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:03.809
I think your stuff has kicked in.

00:47:03.809 --> 00:47:05.564
I told you it's good stuff.

00:47:05.736 --> 00:47:09.493
Who knows? Tonight, he might even
recall memories from his past life.

00:47:11.479 --> 00:47:12.166
Good.

00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:15.031
So I can be free for the next three months.

00:47:18.097 --> 00:47:20.801
But I think we should redo it.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:22.420
Redo what?

00:47:23.229 --> 00:47:24.514
Haven't you seen it in the movies?

00:47:24.514 --> 00:47:28.990
When people get hit on the head with
something hard, their memories come back.

00:47:30.216 --> 00:47:31.156
That's absurd.

00:47:31.843 --> 00:47:33.581
That might injure him even more,
and I'll be in trouble.

00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:34.740
Come on, dude.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.986
Just do it as a little prank.

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:37.390
No way. No.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.332
Damn, you're no fun.

00:47:38.766 --> 00:47:39.791
Right, Honey?

00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:40.473
Mm.

00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:42.948
Gosh. How boring.

00:47:42.948 --> 00:47:44.802
Super boring.

00:47:45.783 --> 00:47:46.675
Watch him.

00:47:48.024 --> 00:47:49.742
See if it's the stuff affecting him
or just my charm.

00:48:04.286 --> 00:48:04.973
Wave.

00:48:07.205 --> 00:48:08.458
Wave, are you okay?

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.924
Hey.

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.546
Come on, I'll take you home.

00:48:14.726 --> 00:48:15.344
Get up.

00:48:25.246 --> 00:48:26.448
Shouldn't have been such a showoff.

00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:36.881
Wave!

00:48:37.568 --> 00:48:38.793
Don't hurt me!

00:48:45.317 --> 00:48:46.516
Tum!

00:48:47.865 --> 00:48:48.645
Gosh.

00:49:02.902 --> 00:49:06.184
Thank you for bringing me this far.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.891
Making you happy is my duty,
Your Highness.

00:49:28.869 --> 00:49:29.840
Wave!

00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:34.139
Wave!

00:49:39.485 --> 00:49:40.526
Wave, wait for me.

00:49:40.526 --> 00:49:41.365
Making you happy…

00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:42.696
Wave, wait!

00:49:42.696 --> 00:49:43.794
…is my duty, Your Highness.

00:49:43.794 --> 00:49:44.358
Wave.

00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:46.640
Wave!

00:49:47.302 --> 00:49:49.757
Wave, are you alright?

00:49:52.062 --> 00:49:53.185
Who are you?

00:49:53.675 --> 00:49:54.386
Calm down.

00:49:54.386 --> 00:49:55.926
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:49:56.122 --> 00:49:57.212
I'm taking you home.

00:49:58.659 --> 00:49:59.518
What home?

00:50:00.107 --> 00:50:00.813
I don't have a home.

00:50:00.813 --> 00:50:02.114
Yes, you do.

00:50:02.114 --> 00:50:04.012
Our home, Like Heaven.

00:50:05.018 --> 00:50:05.989
Easy, okay?

00:50:06.529 --> 00:50:08.422
Relax. Relax.

00:50:09.046 --> 00:50:11.229
You're just high right now. It's nothing.

00:50:11.916 --> 00:50:13.572
Take it easy and listen to me.

00:50:14.553 --> 00:50:17.089
I'm Lava. I'm the one who saved your life.

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.957
I named you Wave.

00:50:19.227 --> 00:50:20.175
It's me.

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:22.671
Calm down.

00:50:22.671 --> 00:50:24.187
You're just high and there's no danger.

00:50:24.874 --> 00:50:25.943
Trust me.

00:50:26.679 --> 00:50:27.984
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:50:29.308 --> 00:50:31.308
I'm Lava. I'm the one who saved your life.

00:50:38.175 --> 00:50:39.009
Help me.

00:50:41.463 --> 00:50:43.955
It's okay. It's all good.

00:50:47.634 --> 00:50:49.585
Take it easy. It's nothing.

00:50:51.326 --> 00:50:53.819
Holy shit, is he okay?

00:50:54.162 --> 00:50:55.563
Wave, I'm sorry.

00:50:57.157 --> 00:50:58.443
He's high.

00:50:59.718 --> 00:51:01.984
Let's take him home. I'll drive. Come on.

00:51:02.303 --> 00:51:03.720
Damn it. Wave, I'm sorry.

00:51:03.916 --> 00:51:05.347
It's okay, it's okay.

00:51:05.887 --> 00:51:06.523
Come on.

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:07.830
Come. Let's go home.

00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:10.523
Get up. One, two, three.

00:51:12.387 --> 00:51:13.495
Here, let me help.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.481
Feeling better?

00:51:51.702 --> 00:51:54.513
If you ever feel sick, let me know.

00:52:28.618 --> 00:52:29.867
Why are you shaking?

00:52:30.186 --> 00:52:30.962
Are you okay?

00:52:42.388 --> 00:52:44.555
Can you come up and sleep next to me?

00:53:18.569 --> 00:53:20.621
Can you please hug me?

00:53:42.526 --> 00:53:45.854
I want to remember who I am.

00:53:53.432 --> 00:53:54.560
I will help you.

00:54:04.425 --> 00:54:06.075
One, two, three, go.

00:54:36.759 --> 00:54:37.570
Hey!

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:38.232
Hey!

00:54:38.232 --> 00:54:38.924
Ouch!

00:54:40.518 --> 00:54:41.479
Who are you?!

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.968
I'm sorry.

00:56:37.874 --> 00:56:41.806
DIRECTED BY
TICHAKORN PHUKHAOTONG

00:56:51.945 --> 00:56:53.895
He hasn't picked up his phone, Anya?

00:56:54.165 --> 00:56:55.485
Not yet, Mother.

00:56:55.632 --> 00:56:57.555
I haven't been able to reach him for days.

00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:59.928
Is something happening to Davin?

00:57:00.443 --> 00:57:02.446
I'll have my men in Thailand help look.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.587
It's my fault for letting him go.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.519
Davin has always been
a little rebel since he was a child.

00:57:12.157 --> 00:57:13.235
Don't blame yourself.

00:57:17.012 --> 00:57:20.410
I promise I will bring him back.

00:57:32.847 --> 00:57:33.744
What is going on?

00:57:34.529 --> 00:57:36.014
We don't have a meeting scheduled.

00:57:36.014 --> 00:57:37.084
Leave for now.

00:57:37.574 --> 00:57:39.942
I'm dealing with a family matter.

00:57:40.604 --> 00:57:42.445
You're not the one
who gives orders anymore.

00:57:43.205 --> 00:57:44.854
You must listen to me.

00:57:45.394 --> 00:57:47.826
I'm the most powerful man in Arantha.

00:57:58.028 --> 00:57:58.864
Victor.

00:57:59.722 --> 00:58:00.773
When did you get back?

00:58:00.871 --> 00:58:02.634
What about Davin? Where is he?

00:58:03.664 --> 00:58:06.160
Prince Davin wished
to stay in Thailand indefinitely

00:58:06.577 --> 00:58:08.498
and will not return home.

00:58:08.939 --> 00:58:12.801
He has also decided
to give up his position as heir.

00:58:14.567 --> 00:58:15.407
That's not true.

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.348
Davin would never leave us.

00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:21.444
What happened to my son?

00:58:22.033 --> 00:58:23.222
Don't worry.

00:58:24.105 --> 00:58:26.943
Soon, all three of you will join the prince.

00:58:27.777 --> 00:58:30.136
Once I wrap up my business here,

00:58:30.686 --> 00:58:33.929
Arantha will be mine completely,

00:58:35.989 --> 00:58:40.153
and Victor will be the sole heir to the throne.

00:58:58.802 --> 00:59:01.734
I want to know if someone
who's lost their memories

00:59:01.734 --> 00:59:04.520
can still remember their sexual orientation.

00:59:04.912 --> 00:59:06.317
Don't sexually harass me.

00:59:06.979 --> 00:59:09.655
I still have doubts about that employee.

00:59:09.655 --> 00:59:11.395
Do you think he's the one who assaulted you?

00:59:11.395 --> 00:59:14.240
It's surprising that
Uncle Peng and Dr. Wut are boyfriends.

00:59:14.286 --> 00:59:15.796
Why would they need to hide it from me?

00:59:15.796 --> 00:59:17.343
They probably have their reasons.

00:59:17.735 --> 00:59:19.758
Do you know that Tum likes Kratae?

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:22.152
I don't like women. I like men.

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:28.382
Memories are stimulated through senses and touch.
