00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.800
Thank you for saving me.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.880
Don't mention it.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.040
You saved me first after all.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.480
But you're not a strong swimmer.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.240
Why risk your life to save me?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.360
In Li Manor,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.360
no one except my mother

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.280
has ever treated me this way.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.848
Xuan,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.160
you must learn to protect yourself.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.360
Don't trust others easily.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.320
Superficial kindness

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080
is all deceit and pretense.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.960
They don't truly care about you.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.240
Mother.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.800
Mother.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.440
This is what you dropped
by the river that day.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.080
Let me put it on for you.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.960
Something just occurred to me.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.520
I saw before the one who pushed me

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.800
into the water.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.480
Pre-Qingming tea,

malt syrup and pepper powder.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.200
Could she give you the formula?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.400
Trust me, boss.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.000
I obtained this formula

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.840
from Madam Li

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.440
through deception.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.120
You sure it's this formula?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.184
This...

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.280
A hawk trainer

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.800
got pecked by a chick?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.840
How shameful!

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.720
A woman was

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.040
playing tricks on me?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.680
I'll go capture her right now!

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.000
Stop!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.640
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.480
With the current intense scrutiny,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.280
you shouldn't linger here.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.440
Lay low at my suburban residence.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.928
Stay there.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.400
Don't cause any more trouble!

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.320
It's secluded there.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.480
No one will find you.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.480
After I clean up your mess,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.880
I'll bring you back.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.776
Don't worry.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.040
Boss, if something happens to me,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.560
will you protect me?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.400
Don't worry. I'll handle everything.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.856
You'll be safe.

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:02.784
Don't worry.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.000
Go now. Just go!

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.520
I'll take my leave then.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.960
Everything happens for the best.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240
Gentlemen,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.760
which lady's tea will you try today?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.360
We're not here for the ladies today.
We're looking for men.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.656
Men?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.960
We'd like to meet all the male staff

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.240
working here.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.800
Well...

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.040
We've never had such a request.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.760
We're here for entertainment.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960
Any gender is okay.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.504
Sister.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.000
Miss Niaoniao,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.440
you've come just in time.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.520
They...

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.240
They want the male staff.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.240
Mr. Li, I regret to inform you

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.640
the Pipa that is supposed
to be played for you

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.280
is not here today.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.240
Where might this Pipa be then?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.960
Perhaps the instrument sensed

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.480
such distinguished guests
like you would arrive today,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.000
grew stage fright,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.760
snapped its strings,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.600
and was sent for repairs elsewhere.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.120
If you seek the Pipa's melody,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.280
you can visit this place.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.256
Thank you.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.880
An address?

00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:14.240
(Court of Justice)
Your Honor, I am Li Zixuan.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.000
We beg for justice!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.864
(Main Hall)

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.240
The head of Wang's Tea Estate

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.680
ordered his man Qin Si
to abduct my wife and force her

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.920
to surrender the milk tea recipe,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.720
and attempted to murder her!

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.760
Mr. Wang,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.800
do you admit guilt?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.520
Your Honor, this is slander!

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.760
As everyone knows,

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.840
my family and the Li family
share a generational bond.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.920
Zixuan is like a nephew to me.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.840
Why would I harm my nephew's wife?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.240
I beg for a fair investigation.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.840
Madam Li's petition clearly states

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.240
the crimes in detail.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.200
The person who abducted her was Qin Si.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.320
And Qin Si happens to be your servant.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.440
How do you explain this?

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.600
Qin Si is a servant in my household.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.280
I am engaging in big business.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.360
Variability in personnel quality
is inevitable.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.280
Mr. Wang, the accusations
written in my petition

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.080
were all confessed
by your trusted aide Qin Si.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.160
Although Qin Si works in my household,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.280
he's merely an ordinary servant.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.040
How could he be
considered a trusted aide?

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.560
Your Honor, what I've said is true.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.600
If you don't believe me,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.400
you can summon Qin Si to confront me.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.160
Mr. Wang,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.400
you know perfectly well

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.720
Qin Si has fled to avoid punishment.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.960
How can I bring him for confrontation?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.840
He fled? Then you
should pursue the guilty one.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.560
You should first apprehend
Qin Si before anything else.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.200
Mr. Wang, are you implying

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.840
that even if Qin Si is found,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.240
you have no connection with him

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.640
and will never cover for him

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.600
or defend him?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.600
Of course.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.080
If he truly committed crimes,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.640
I would never condone it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.680
His punishment shall be
at your discretion, Your Honor.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.720
In that case,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.720
Your Honor, summon the witness.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.600
Summon witness Qin Si to the court.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.760
State your name.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.560
My name is Qin Si.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.328
Mr. Wang,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.800
Qin Si

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.800
was found

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.120
at your suburban private residence.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.400
Private residence?

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.200
That residence
hasn't been occupied for years.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.120
Qin Si,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.920
how could you steal my key

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.680
and stay in that residence?

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.712
Me?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.560
Honey,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.200
if that's the case,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.680
we've wrongfully accused Mr. Wang.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.360
Qin Si is Mr. Wang's servant,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.680
but he stole his key

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.160
and hid in his private residence.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.304
How about this?

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.320
We drop charges against Mr. Wang.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.144
Your Honor,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.880
we'll charge Qin Si instead.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.240
No! Wait, Boss...

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.120
That's not...

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.800
Didn't you promise to protect me?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.720
Didn't you say everything
happened for the best?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.408
What about your promise?

00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:26.880
Shut up, Qin Si!

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.360
You did all this yourself!

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.440
Nothing to do with me!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.280
Stop spouting nonsense!

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.080
You... Okay.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.800
Your Honor!

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.480
Everything I did
was under my boss's orders!

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.320
He told me to lay low

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.200
at his suburban residence.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.080
And he also instructed me

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.080
to steal the milk tea formula!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.560
Darling,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.280
Qin Si's words make some sense.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.360
It seems

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.360
Mr. Wang was pulling
the strings all along.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.800
Let's continue accusing Mr. Wang.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.640
Wait a minute!

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.880
He's falsely accusing me!

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.680
Qin Si, I've always treated you well.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.120
You saw an opportunity
for wealth and attempted

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.360
to murder my niece-in-law.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.200
How dare you claim I ordered this?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.280
Me? What are you talking about?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.712
How could you do this to me?

00:12:19.712 --> 00:12:20.576
You...

00:12:20.576 --> 00:12:22.040
Go away!

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.600
Earlier,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.040
Mr. Li and Mrs. Li told me

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.080
you would surely deny involvement

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.240
and make me take the blame.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.880
I didn't believe it then!

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.520
Though I am a lowlife,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.680
I won't die in vain!

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.880
Darling, I think both of them

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.480
make valid points.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.528
Honey,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.160
their back-and-forth accusations

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.400
have left me confused.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.680
But I notice today's event

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.680
resembles your accident at Fairy Cliff

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.280
from before.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.136
Darling,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.040
are you suggesting

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.320
the danger I encountered
at Fairy Cliff that day

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.400
was also orchestrated by Mr. Wang?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.672
Your Honor.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.800
The person who pushed him off the cliff

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.160
has nothing to do with me!

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.120
Your Honor.

00:13:21.184 --> 00:13:22.160
It was Mr. Wang

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.480
who instructed me to have a man

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.320
disguised as a tea farmer to do it.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.760
Is this true?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800
Your Honor, it is true.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.424
But

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.480
I just said

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.800
I encountered danger at Fairy Cliff.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.240
I never claimed

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.680
that someone pushed me off the cliff.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.016
Mr. Wang,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.240
how do you know these details?

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:51.800
Your Honor.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.640
I heard this matter

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.200
from their servants.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.600
Honey,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.440
if we look at it this way,

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.840
I actually think

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.480
it seems Qin Si is lying.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.960
He is a servant of the Wang family.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.000
Why would Mr. Wang trust him so much

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.520
as to share
all these confidential matters with him?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.520
He must be spouting nonsense.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.600
We've wrongly accused Mr. Wang.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.960
Perhaps we should charge Qin Si instead.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.720
I...

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.736
No!

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.440
Your Honor.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.120
Although I'm merely Mr. Wang's servant,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.240
I previously acted on his orders

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.880
to mix Chuanwu powder

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.160
into Li family's tribute tea.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.200
That's why I gained
Mr. Wang's trust and promotion.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.144
Mr. Wang,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.360
is this true?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.800
Your Honor,
don't listen to his one-sided claims!

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.000
He...

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.880
Qin Si...

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.640
He's gone mad! He's insane!

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.600
I'm insane?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.568
Qin Si.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.480
You keep claiming
that everything you did

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.360
was under Mr. Wang's orders.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.520
Do you have any evidence?

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.920
No evidence.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.720
Without evidence,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.800
how dare you frame me?

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.520
How ridiculous.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.280
A treacherous slave
like you deserves punishment!

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440
Ungrateful wretch!

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.800
Even at death's door,
you are making false accusations!

00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:14.520
Honey,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.240
it seems we truly

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.560
wronged Mr. Wang.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.280
Qin Si

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.240
really has no evidence.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.280
Darling,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.520
if Qin Si were truly
Wang's confidential servant,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.560
wouldn't he know many of their secrets?

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:33.696
Right!

00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:34.840
Your Honor.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.280
I truly do know

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.480
a secret of the Wang family.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.880
Say it.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.400
My boss increased sales

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.040
by ordering the girls
at Tianxiang Tea House

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.520
to add incense and anesthetics

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.200
to customers' tea.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.840
This made customers dazed

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.888
and spend more money.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.360
But prolonged use

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.320
of the incense and anesthetics

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.960
causes physical harm

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.600
and could even kill people!

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.600
Mr. Wang,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.560
is this true?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.320
Of course not!

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.040
I conduct business honorably.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.400
I'd never use such despicable methods!

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.920
Unsubstantiated words.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.840
Qin Si, do you have evidence?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.080
Those girls were bought by Mr. Wang.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.320
How dare they show evidence?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.120
Without evidence,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.800
you still try to frame me?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.480
Now, I want to know

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.840
who instructed you to frame me!

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.560
I can testify.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.280
Your Honor.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.320
I'm a hostess at Tianxiang Tea House

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.560
named Niaoniao.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.720
I can prove

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.720
what Qin Si said is true.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.480
Mr. Wang did force us

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.280
to drug customers.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.880
If you don't believe me,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.640
you can search the tea house.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.480
Under every girl's dressing table,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.600
there's a hidden drawer.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.600
You'll know whether this is true

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.000
after searching.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.320
Since we have
both witnesses and evidence,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.040
detain Mr. Wang and Qin Si

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.280
and put them in jail first.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.480
Search Tianxiang Tea House immediately.
