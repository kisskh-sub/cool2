How did you convince
Niaoniao to testify in court?

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.520
It wasn't exactly persuasion.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
We were just using each other.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760
All their servitude contracts
are held by Mr. Wang.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.480
Mr. Wang usually

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.080
exploits and mistreats them.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.280
Now that Mr. Wang is imprisoned,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.240
they can naturally
reclaim their contracts

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.880
and regain their freedom.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.000

Hello. I'm Hassan.

(Hassan, Persian merchant)
A Persian merchant.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.280
You must be Madam Li.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.120
You know me?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.520
I've long heard of you.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.360
I've heard

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.600
- Young Master, look!
- you're the inventor of milk tea.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.512
Look.

00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:09.360
Not the inventor.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.280
More like an inspired adaptation.

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:13.440
- You're too modest.
- Who's he?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.200
He seems to be a merchant from Persia.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.416
The taste

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.520
is extraordinary.

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:20.560
But

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.080
I have a small suggestion.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.640
I wonder if I should tell you.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.216
Go ahead.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.528
Look.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.600
Your milk tea costs several times
more than regular tea,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.720
but ultimately, it's just a beverage.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.984
It doesn't satisfy hunger.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.400
Only suitable for leisure.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.880
If you add glutinous rice balls

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.760
and fruit pulp,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.880
it could serve not just as tea

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.840
but also as sustenance.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.360
Why not just tell me

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.600
to add pearls and coconut jelly?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.240
You also traveled to this world?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.280
What do you mean?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.440
I'm from Persia.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.160
Never mind.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.560
We'll all be friends from now on anyway.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.680
Nice working with you.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.808
Young Master.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.600
What's this for?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.480
Come, I'll show you inside.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.440
Young Master,
should we really hang this?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.440
Just hang it as told.

Young Master,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.000
are you jealous?

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.520
Me?

00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:49.800
(No Persians Allowed)

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.080

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.096
Understood?

00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.920
(No Persians Allowed)

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.440
Why exclude Persians?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.560
Ignore that.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.920
Business as usual.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.520
Do you guys hate Persians?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.656
No.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.200
Bigger than black beans,
and smaller than grapes.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.680
What are these soft and chewy things?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800
These are called pearls.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.376
Try them.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.080
Theoretically,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.040
these should be made of cornstarch

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.480
and sweet potato starch.

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:43.760
But

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.120
there is no such thing here,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.040
so I had to use

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.560
other grains.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.000
The taste must be similar.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.240
Try it now.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.304
Okay.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.720
It is tasty, right?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.280
Thanks to that Persian merchant.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.640
Otherwise,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.040
I might have forgotten this entirely.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.200
Tasteless,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400
like chewing wax.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.440
Nothing special on their own.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.920
When being added in milk tea,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.880
it becomes tasty.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.960
I saw you chatting
with that Persian today.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.440
You seemed to be having
a great conversation.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.720
It was great.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.560
He shared numerous ideas

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.120
about milk tea improvement

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.600
and gave suggestions,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.040
which are quite reasonable.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.064
Why discuss improvements with him?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920
Why can't I

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.360
discuss improvements with him?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.360
Why consult him?

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.280
Why can't I

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.160
consult him about improvements?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.120
What I meant is,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.120
why didn't you discuss it with me first?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.440
I'm telling you right now, aren't I?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.120
What's wrong with you today?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.400
This was just a minor issue.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.400
Minor issue?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.600
This is between the two of us.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.080
Why did you involve an outsider?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.520
Okay.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.680
I'll listen to you from now on.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.960
In three days,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.880
the Tea Merchants Guild is holding
a banquet at Zhenxiu Restaurant.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.160
You'll accompany me.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.376
I won't go.

00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:18.800
The milk tea stall has

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.120
many things I need to attend to.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.640
Go by yourself.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.920
You must come with me.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.760
Why?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.440
This is the annual

When you accompany me,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.040
they'll know

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.960
you are my wife,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.040
the Madam of our family.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.640
Public announcement?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040
What did you say?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.920
Nothing.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.560
Fine, I'll go with you.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.240
Go with you.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.280
Didn't you say it tasted bad?

00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:02.560
(Zhenxiu Restaurant)
So you must be Madam Li.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.840
Let's toast to you!

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.416
To everyone.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.440
Mr. Li,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.440
we'll need to rely on
your family more often.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.000
Today, we must
congratulate the Li family

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.000
on becoming Haiqing's top tea merchant.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Your business

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.480
is thriving spectacularly.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.040
Here.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.280
You all flatter us.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.880
All credit goes to my daughter-in-law.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.920
If not for her intelligence

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.840
and dedication

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.800
in managing our family enterprises,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.880
we wouldn't have today's success.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.040
We should toast to her.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.920
I don't deserve such praise.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.240
Madam Li.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.304
Another toast to everyone.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.760
Madam Li, you are so excellent.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760
I must

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.920
toast you again.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.480
To Madam and Mr. Li

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.240
for eliminating that despicable
Mr. Wang from our industry.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.480
My husband

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.760
has been full of praise for Madam Li.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.320
Our duty.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.600
We've long heard
of your wisdom and competence.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.800
And today, I've found

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.280
your reputation is deserved.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.040
Let me toast to you again.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.480
We hope you will

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.400
share more business strategies with us.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.320
Truly impressive.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.440
Regarding business strategies,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.000
I do have some unique methods.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.736
Miss.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.760
Excuse me for a moment.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.048
You go ahead.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.360
- Your daughter-in-law is a credit
- What's wrong?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.600
- to your household management.
- Hassan wants to discuss

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.720
trade cooperation with you in a room.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.400
Business within our reach.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520
I'll check it out.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.560
Miss.

00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:52.560
Meeting a man privately
will cause trouble.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.240
It's fine.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.000
Fetch Zixuan

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.640
and have him come to the room.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.120
Cuicui.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.880
Lady, you summoned me?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.560
I think I've had too much to drink.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.280
Bring me some tea.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.736
Yes.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.864
Where is he?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.592
Hassan?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.768
Hassan?

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.296
Hassan?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.944
Madam Li.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.040
Everyone, together.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.248
Cheers.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.528
Cheers.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400
Mr. Li.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.384
Miss Niaoniao.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.080
Have you seen my wife?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.840
Madam Li

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.160
had too much to drink earlier.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.480
It seemed a man

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.920
was helping her to a room.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.520
Hassan.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840
Mr. Li,

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.800
she likely drank too much.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.160
Please don't misunderstand.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.360
In a few days,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.880
I'll visit the temple to pray
for my son's marital bliss.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.360
Good idea. Let's go together.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720
Where's Madam Li?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.184
Madam Li?

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.360
Zixuan! Zixuan!

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.680
Zixuan, stop!

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.480
If any harm comes to my wife,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.320
I'll kill you!

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:45.632
Exactly.

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:48.096
I told you! Acting shamelessly
without decency.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.520
Who'd have thought Mr. Wei's daughter

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.960
would be so frivolous?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.560
In broad daylight,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.400
she committed such shameless acts!

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.440
Exactly.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.440
When I saw what was
happening in that room,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.120
even I was quite ashamed.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.920
She caused such a scandal

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.880
and made it known to all!

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.040
How will the women of our family

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.400
face people hereafter?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.656
Sister,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.040
we all know you value propriety most.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.040
A hussy like Wei Xiaotang

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.680
deserves to be divorced!

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.432
Yes! Divorce is the only way.

00:13:30.432 --> 00:13:31.320
Exactly.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.840
This scandal caused huge uproars.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.040
If she's not divorced,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.120
how can you and your family
hold your heads high?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.160
True.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.320
(Wei Xiaotang,)

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.960
(once a woman gets tainted,)

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.520
(even if her husband dotes on her,)

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.680
(he can't protect her.)
