[Episode 8]

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.460
Chief, be careful.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.220
Commissioner Luo, so you're here.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.800
[Acting Chief Cao Yuanzhong promoted
to Chief of Shanghai BIS]

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.660
Congratulations, Commissioner Luo.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.540
Director Dai personally telegraphed
to commend you.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.380
You're about to go
back to Chongqing, right?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.220
The original text of this telegram is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.130
that former Acting Chief of Shanghai
BIS, Cao Yuanzhong,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.820
and Special Commissioner Luo Han

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.980
made meritorious contributions
in leading Sword Thrust Operation,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.660
hereby

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.820
Cao Yuanzhong is promoted to Chief
of Shanghai BIS

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.340
as a commendation.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.820
You're the focus of
this commendation, Chief Cao.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.980
I'm flattered.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.100
This operation

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.850
was thanks to you and Yangshan

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.820
fighting hard on the front lines.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.220
The Party-State's hopes

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.660
still rest on you young people.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.850
I heard that the Bureau

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.850
will immediately initiate
the Joseph Lee Plan,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.660
codenamed Sword Thrust Operation,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.500
and have Gu Yangshan and Ding Yi
form an independent team

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.500
under your direct leadership.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.380
Yes.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.340
The burden on my shoulders
is getting heavier.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.780
But for the Party-State,
I won't shirk my duty.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.820
In this operation, Yangshan

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.660
also made great contributions.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.380
Director Dai and I have already agreed

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.100
that Joseph Lee

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.100
must be placed in the
Special Agent Headquarters in advance

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.850
and Yangshan shall be solely
responsible for the operation.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.980
Don't disturb him with

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.500
any miscellaneous matters.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.220
Ding Yi is taking tonight's ship

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.100
to China Hong Kong.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.810
Oh?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.100
He's leaving?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.100
He's not one of us.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.340
He doesn't need your approval to leave,
right, Chief Cao?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.020
Besides,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.900
we tricked him into staying

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.220
by using his mother's matter.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.780
Now that it's over.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.780
He has no reason to stay.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.340
Even if I let him go,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.460
the Japanese wouldn't let him go.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.220
What we're worried about now

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.100
isn't whether Ding Yi is willing to join

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.340
the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.340
But rather, who else

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.580
is involved

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.460
in the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.580
You want to investigate the Communists?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.140
We had just sounded the air raid alarm,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.780
and almost at the same time,
the Communists

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.900
also sounded their air raid alarm.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.340
If we can root out

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.340
these Communists following this clue,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.460
could we possibly let this chance slip?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.780
I spent a long time choosing.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.580
This is the only one that looks decent.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.660
If you want to buy a better one,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.100
I'll get a jeweler
to custom-make it for you.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.140
No need for that trouble.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.780
Hongyu is not that picky.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.780
I don't want it to be so fancy.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.290
When I was fleeing famine,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.780
I fell seriously ill.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.170
It was Hongyu

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.340
who sold her gold earrings

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.580
to save me.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.020
I swore at that time,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.340
as soon as I hit it big and make money,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.540
I'd buy her whatever she wants.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.460
So this bracelet is just a start.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.460
When I get to China Hong Kong

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.580
and make big money...

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.580
What's wrong?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.340
Look ahead.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.660
Sir, we couldn't find anything.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.780
Take these people back
for an interrogation.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.580
Pack up everything inside
with writing

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.900
and send it to the Japanese.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.140
We don't need to bother with the rest.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.660
Got it.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.220
Step aside!

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.660
Wait.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.340
Did Mr. Takeda send you?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.780
Let them go.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.460
I'll go with you to find him.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.660
What Takeda, Makeda nonsense?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.340
We're on official duty
from the Concession Police Station.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.580
We received a report

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.780
that someone in Chaosheng Troupe

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.020
is privately hiding opium!

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.020
Who are you guys?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.020
Inspector.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.340
Calm down.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.460
You said there's opium
in Chaosheng Troupe.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.780
Where is your evidence?

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.900
Where is your evidence?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.460
Where is your evidence?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.660
You ask me for evidence?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.140
Sure.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.780
Of course I have evidence.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.580
Show us!

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.660
Show it to us.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.340
We just found some authentic red soil.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.700
Hard evidence.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.780
Would we dare arrest someone
without evidence?

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.140
Let me tell you this.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.900
Once you're in our police station,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.660
no one's gonna help you.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.370
If you want to bail people out,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.580
come find me, Li Boyao.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.900
Do you understand me?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.140
Of course.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.780
Okay.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.340
Sir.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.780
Enjoy your coffee.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.580
Let's go.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.340
Put them here.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.820
That's everything.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.850
Mr. Takeda.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.100
They were all brought
to the police station.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.220
They said

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.460
they'll have the statements sorted
and sent over in three days.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.820
That's too slow.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.100
If I'm not mistaken,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.850
isn't Dr. Miyamoto's ship

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.850
arriving in Shanghai soon?

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.820
Yes.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.460
He should arrive this week.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.980
I'll go check right now.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.820
When Joseph Lee calls,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.420
tell him I'm out.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.820
Then let him know

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.180
Dr. Miyamoto will be
in Shanghai this week

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.730
to consult on his eye disease.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.340
With Dr. Miyamoto here,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.580
he won't be able to leave.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.820
What blind man would turn down

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.940
a shot at gaining eyesight again?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.580
Right?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.820
Okay.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.980
Please let Mr. Takeda know

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.820
when he gets back

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.060
[Public Phone]
that Mr. Lee is anxious to meet him.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.580
What did he say?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.340
Kobayashi said Takeda's not there.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.580
Takeda just doesn't want to talk to you.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.820
He also said Dr. Miyamoto's
arriving next week

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.820
to treat your eyes.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.220
It's obvious that
he doesn't want you to leave.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.980
Seeing the troupe in this situation,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.820
I can't leave.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.580
Are you serious?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.060
You have to leave, understand?

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.530
Excuse me, I need to use the phone.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.100
Sorry.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.100
Takeda had the police
arresting people like this.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.490
It means

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.220
he doesn't trust Joseph Lee's identity

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.420
as the foster son.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.580
But until he figures things out,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.700
he can't do anything

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.340
because of Joseph Lee's
connection to Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.580
That's why he's using the police
to make the arrests.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.060
If Joseph Lee vanishes right now,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.490
then the people from Chaosheng Troupe

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.220
won't matter to him anymore.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.980
That'd actually keep the troupe safe.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.820
You need to leave now,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.610
as soon as possible.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.340
This is all just your guesswork.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.460
What if you're wrong?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.580
If something goes wrong,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.340
what will happen to the troupe?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.940
Keep your voice down.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.220
Get in the car.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.610
I'm not leaving.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.220
I need to find a way to save them.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.700
Get in first.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.580
I'll help you think of a way.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.340
Li Boyao is Cao Yuanzhong's
brother-in-law.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.220
But he's a total money-grubber.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.490
I'll find a way to get the people out.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.180
Get in the car.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.940
Come back next time.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.220
Okay.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.580
Joseph Lee code's been scrapped.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.220
My mission is done.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.940
I should head back to Chongqing
to report right away.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.820
I wish you smooth sailing

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.130
and make great success here in Shanghai,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.490
Chief Cao.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.100
Thank you, thank you.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.460
Warehouse No. 8

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.700
needs shipping.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.420
Commissioner Luo.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.300
See?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.180
I told you

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.580
they can't leave.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.610
Are you really going to stand by?

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.940
No, I must save them.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.820
Not only will we save them,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.340
we have to make a trip ourselves.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.580
Look over there.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.460
He's staring.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.820
So,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.340
you are like the attractive siren,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.100
bringing chaos to the Huangpu River.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.220
Back then,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.700
marshals and committee members

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.460
were chasing after you,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.100
spending money like water.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.580
How could you just ignore them all?

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.580
I'm not as desperate
to marry as you are,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.580
rushing to clutch a coffin lid
for the rest of your life.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.460
Liang is a great man.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.340
Must you speak so meanly?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.300
Biyun.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.420
Your turn to play this hand.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.220
Be bolder.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.420
Follow along.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.980
I know you.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.300
You

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.100
don't want a coffin lid.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.490
You want

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.580
a gold mine!

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.100
You're my God of Wealth!

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.300
Waiter!

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.580
Congratulations, Ms. Ye,
you've won again.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.100
This lady is really lucky.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.820
Let's have a drink.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.340
Thanks.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.100
How long has it been?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.820
Why isn't he here yet?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.980
Be careful.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.820
Do you remember everything I told you?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.380
I do.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.740
No matter what Mr. Cao says,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.380
I'll definitely leave.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.020
But don't forget

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.460
the thing you promised me.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.020
If we can't save
the people from the troupe,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.020
I'm certainly not leaving.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.020
Alright, I remember.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.860
But I'm telling you,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.220
just do exactly as I say.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.140
Don't worry.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.860
In this place,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.620
if I want to leave, no one can stop me.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.860
When Joseph Lee was alive,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.380
I never walked out
that front door properly.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.530
Their car is here.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.380
Go.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.140
What are you doing?

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.860
I'll hide first for safety.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.290
Knock and let me know
when the deal is done.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.100
Wait.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.860
Just knock.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.860
No.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.500
What now?

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.980
I'd better listen from outside,

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.530
in case anything goes wrong.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.260
If anything happens, knock.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.140
Why are you hiding in the closet?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.100
If we can settle it,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.980
it'll be awkward for you to walk out.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.020
I'll get you 100 first.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.620
Ladies, a cigar?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.860
No, thanks.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.260
I hear Westerners

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.090
love oriental charm the most.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.020
If you get yourself an old British man,

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.330
you don't even have to
lift your little finger, right?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.260
Yeah.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.570
But he just left without a care.

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.050
All my efforts these years

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.810
were for nothing.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.740
Biyun.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.660
We've been close friends for years.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.330
There are some things
I can't hide from you.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.980
The Japanese think that
you have something

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.020
to do with the code leak,

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.260
and sent me to investigate you.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.810
Just come clean with me.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.500
Did you also sell this information

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.570
to the Communists?

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.810
The Communists?

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.570
Can they even afford that money?

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.700
If I wanted,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.180
I could go to any rich man here.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.700
The night's earnings from it

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.660
would be more than that.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.570
Stop teasing me.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.180
The Japanese are already suspicious.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.660
If I don't figure it out,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.530
others will come to investigate.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.050
They won't let it go

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.180
until they get to the bottom of it.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.020
Biyun.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.050
You'd better tell me the truth.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.530
After all these years in the Concession,

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.050
Brits, Americans, the French.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.660
I've seen them all come and go.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.700
You think they can scare me?

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.370
I've said all I can.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.700
If you don't believe me,

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.770
give me a bullet at worst.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.770
Don't say such things.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.460
I'm different from them.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.180
I'm always on your side.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.220
Alright.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.180
I know you.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.660
You're only in it for the money.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.810
Please understand me.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.460
I have to give the Japanese
an explanation.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.500
What explanation do you want?

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.180
From the looks of it now,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.460
the Japanese must've misunderstood you.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.090
How about I find a chance

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.940
to arrange a meeting with Mr. Takeda?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.090
You can clear things up face-to-face.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.290
Alright?

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.090
Find a chance?

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.180
Ms. Ye, here are your winnings.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.290
The new government is establishing
its own intelligence system.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.810
Tomorrow night,
there's a meet-and-greet ball.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.180
Liang definitely can't go.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.290
Accompany me for a dance.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.660
So,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.660
compared to being a spy,

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.180
you're more suited to be a lobbyist.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.500
That's the intelligence bureau
of the new government.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.330
It's a gold mine
bigger than the British.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.330
Why give it up?

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.330
Take this casino for example,

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.660
I don't care about the British,
French, and Americans.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.570
But once others know

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.180
you have dealings with the Japanese,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.020
they'll see you
like they've seen a ghost,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.330
running away from you immediately,

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.570
as if you're covered
in chicken droppings.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.460
There are so many eyes
on the Bund of Shanghai.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.050
I wouldn't dare

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.570
place this bet lightly.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.570
People have small plans.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.180
God has big plans.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.530
Can people outplan God?

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.460
Come in.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.660
Mr. Cao, please sit.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.420
Where's Ding Yi?

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.570
Inside.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.090
What's the big matter?

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.220
Mr. Cao.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.900
Time is pressing, so I'll be brief.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.260
Everyone in Chaosheng Troupe

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.130
has been taken by the police.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.940
And as far as I know,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.770
Li Boyao,
Inspector of the police station,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.290
is your brother-in-law, right?

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.530
I'm embarrassed.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.290
But don't worry.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.290
I'll talk to him later

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.370
and have him handle the Japanese.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.940
I'll make sure there's no torture.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.660
On behalf of Ding Yi

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.500
and everyone in Chaosheng Troupe,

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.180
I thank you, Mr. Cao.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.900
Nothing else?

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.770
Didn't expect you to agree so quickly.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.460
What are your plans for Ding Yi next?

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.500
Although Joseph Lee's code
has been changed,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.420
the Japanese still don't trust us.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.740
So I plan to send Ding Yi away quickly,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.330
the sooner the better.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.020
Who said Ding Yi is leaving?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.180
Don't look at me.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.530
I've already conveyed

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.810
your message to Chief Cao.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.900
Chief Cao exercises good leadership.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.290
Your Joseph Lee Operation

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.900
became widely known in the Bureau,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.020
and was officially renamed
the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.220
Sword Thrust Operation
is showing initial results.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.810
Now the Japanese are establishing
the Special Agent Headquarters.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.260
Now is exactly when he's most needed.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.500
Your operation

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.090
is of great significance

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.500
to the Shanghai Bureau.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.570
If Director Dai learns
you acted without permission,

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.330
except that I couldn't help you,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.130
even your father

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.290
couldn't help you if he wanted to.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.700
I don't understand.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.850
What does this have to do
with my father?

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.530
You really don't know
or are you pretending?

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.090
This operation exists
because your father

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.570
pushed it through
against all opposition.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.530
Director Dai already knew.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.460
He said when our operation succeeds,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.260
he'll ask for merit in front of
the Chairman on our behalf.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.090
By then, your Gu family

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.500
will surely get

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.260
two Yunhui Medals.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.090
And if we fail,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.370
we won't avoid

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.460
two bullets, right?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.700
Failure is one thing,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.180
being a deserter is another.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.020
Yangshan.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.180
I'm your teacher.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.090
I can't watch you go astray.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.770
You're not really going
to disobey orders, are you?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.090
No.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.180
Good, you're not.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.770
Within this week,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.530
the Japanese imperial eye doctor

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.770
will come to examine Ding Yi.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.090
But we really can't keep acting anymore.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.050
Just this?

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.330
And you're this scared?

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.020
I thought it was something serious.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.260
Isn't this a trivial matter?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.570
How can this be trivial?

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.420
Of course it's not trivial.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.180
Even if Ding Yi were the best actor,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.530
could he fool a doctor

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.290
and all those

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.090

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.180
Mr. Cao, why don't you sit here?

00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.570
Come here.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.940
You come here.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.050
What if

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.420
he were really blind?

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.020
What do you mean?

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.090
Back when Director Dai

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.700
decided to continue
the Sword Thrust Operation,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.460
I'd been thinking

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.460
he can't keep pretending to be blind.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.020
That's not right.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.180
So I specifically asked

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.810
the American doctor
who treated the Chairman's wife,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.810
and he told me

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.220
that the U.S. military
developed a neurotoxin.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.700
Just one injection of it around the eye,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.810
and it'll completely destroy
his optic nerve

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.500
in less than five minutes.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.700
I just got it this afternoon.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.810
Isn't this perfect timing

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.330
to use it?

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.570
That's what I call being prepared.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.330

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.570

No, Mr. Cao.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.420
But you say,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.370
if we blind Ding Yi,

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.130
won't we dishearten

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.060
I'll go to Chaosheng Theatre

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.900
and see if there are any clues.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.340
Are you determined to send Ding Yi away?

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.420
Uncle Gu was killed before my eyes,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.020
and I had to pretend not to know him.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:00.900
I won't let this situation

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.900
happen to Ding Yi again.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.610
You!

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.060
Come here!

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.570
Let him go!

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.340
Sir, this way please.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.940
I'm telling you, brother-in-law.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.340
At the moment,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.020
I haven't even finished
my job for the Japanese.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.170
How do I have time
to handle this for you?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.730
Sir, right this way, please.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.020
I gotta go now.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.060
Captain Kobayashi.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.170
You came at just the right time.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.420
I'm interrogating these people.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.900
But they all say

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.900
they don't know this female
Communist Zhu Hongyu.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.980
So don't be impatient.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.900
Give me some time

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.570
so I can get them to talk.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.380
Leave those others aside.
This one is the priority.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.020
What?

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.610
Leave those others aside.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.820
This one is the priority.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.610
Last night at the Metropolitan Hotel,

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.060
he disappeared
while avoiding an assassination.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.610
He's a British national.
Likely didn't leave the Concession.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.460
Find him as soon as possible.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.900
What?

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.900
Last night,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.290
at the Metropolitan Hotel,

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.900
he disappeared while
avoiding an assassination.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.420
He's a British national.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.210
Likely didn't leave the Concession.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.130
Find him as soon as possible.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.980
Kobayashi.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.170
We're doing business here.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.540
We're doing business.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.570
Before you urged me
to find that female Communist,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.900
and I was working on that for you.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.980
But now you're pushing me
to find this guy.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.420
I've only got so many men.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.690
I'm swamped.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.380
The military police will focus on
searching for the female Communist.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.210
You just make sure
to find Joseph Lee quickly.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.290
Okay.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.570
I know, I know.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.770
No problem.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.290
Hello.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.980
It's me.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.730
Biyun.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.290
I'm truly sorry.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.570
I was in the bath just now,
so I couldn't answer.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.860
I'll go with you

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.860
to tomorrow night's ball.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.380
But I have one condition.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.380
I want to meet Takeda's superior.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.690
Hello.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.500
Brother-in-law.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.340
My goodness.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.420
You sat on my hand.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.860
Doesn't your bottom feel uncomfortable?

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.820
Sorry.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.020
Put your hand up here.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.820
Oh my god.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.170
Three gold bars.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.170
What's the big deal?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.420
Help me find someone.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.290
This person is called Ding Yi.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.420
He's an important piece
on my chessboard.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.500
But now he wants to cut ties.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.420
The Japanese are guarding
all key routes by land and water.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.170
He has a grudge with the Japanese.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.170
I fear he'll take a side dock.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.340
You get him back for me.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.290
If he refuses to come back,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.170
then carry his corpse back to me.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.460
Ding Yi?

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.170
Joseph Lee.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.340
Ding Yi.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.460
Ding Yi.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.690
Joseph Lee.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.460
Brother-in-law, take a look for me.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.860
So annoying.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.690
Even you bully me.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.540
You won't even let me sleep.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.460
Eat, eat, all you know is eat.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.500
See what will they feed you

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.020
when I'm gone.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.940
Want an apple?

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.900
It's good enough
they don't jab you with a needle.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.170
You eat everything! Shoot!

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.730
You even eat the newspaper.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.500
Turn around.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:12.320
[Communist bandit Zhu Hongyu]
[Reward 1,000 silver dollars]

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.610
Hongyu.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.020
Communist?

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.820
Impossible.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.020
I know Ding Yi's temperament.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.420
Unless he has to,

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.420
he wouldn't leave without a word.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.020
What did you do to him?

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.820
Ms. Xian.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.460
Now is not the time to talk about that.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.500
The Japanese have already
notified the police station.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.420
Even if they turn Shanghai upside down,

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.420
they want to find Ding Yi.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.940
The urgent thing is

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.940
to find him before the Japanese do.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.020
Because only I can protect him.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.340
If you could protect him,

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.420
why would he run away?

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:58.860
Ms. Xian.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.020
Ding Yi said before

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.940
that if something happened
to Chaosheng Troupe,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.460
he definitely wouldn't leave Shanghai.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.940
But now all over the streets

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.500
are wanted posters for Hongyu.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.770
I guess there's a high chance
he went to find Hongyu.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.420
Where would Hongyu go?
Who would she find?

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.820
You must tell me

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.340
before it's too late.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.170
I just tricked the Japanese,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.900
saying Joseph Lee fled to avoid

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.770
the Anti-Traitor Squad.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.420
But I don't know

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.420
how long this lie will hold.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.460
I've got a smuggling boat lined up.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.420
If we find Ding Yi,

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.020
I'll send him out of Shanghai
immediately.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.540
But Ms. Xian,

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.020
if we keep delaying like this,

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.860
none of us can know

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.610
what will happen.
