Biyun.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.180
You're really lucky.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.660
You have no idea

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.100
how many times I tried to meet this

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.770
Colonel Sasaki before.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.660
But as soon as he heard
that you were coming,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.180
he immediately agreed to attend.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.900
And he's free today.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.180
I'll come pick you up in a while.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.100
Let's go to Shinmei Salon
and get our hair done.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.900
You must dress up nicely this time.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100
Let those Japanese see clearly

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.690
that when Xian Biyun comes,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.010
all the pretty ladies
will have to step aside.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.100
Ms. Xian.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.100
Hongyu has

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.260
a childhood friend who fled
from the Northeast with her.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.100
His name is Dashun.

Wanted communists.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.380
Hurry, hurry.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.500
A thousand silver dollars.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.380
I've seen someone worth
500 silver dollars before.

[Dashun, Ding Yi's hometown friend]
And he even had a gun.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.500
Not bad.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.610
Today's bait is really big.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.100
Keep your eyes open.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.100
Okay.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.260
What are you looking at? Get to work.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.980
Get to work.

Come, come.

Eat up, come on.

What's going on between you and Hongyu?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.100
The wanted notice

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.820
is up at the train station.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.100
They say she's a communist.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.540
Wasn't she with the troupe?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.370
Now she's doing revolution?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.810
Don't even bring it up.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.780
I...

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.220
I'm really unlucky.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.220
It's a long story.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.540
We'll have plenty of time to chat later.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.980
Right now the priority is to find Hongyu

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.370
and bring her here to you.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.100
You get her a train ticket,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.980
and we'll send her out of here quickly.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.250
Right now in Shanghai,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.370
you're the only person I can trust.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.220
Whether I can live
to see my mother again

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.250
depends on you.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.140
Your mother?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.700
Your mother is my mother.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.540
When we fled from the Northeast,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.780
she pulled the cotton out of her coat
and sewed it into my thin clothes.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.980
That's how I survived.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.220
I still remember

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.660
her always nagging at my ear,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.100
- telling me to live well.
- Telling us to live well.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.220
So you see,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.370
real brothers are the best.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.250
Absolutely.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.660

since we were toddlers.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.370
Alright.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.540
We made it all the way
from the Northeast.

No need, Dashun.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.660
Isn't there food here? A bite is enough.

be in real danger?

It's all the Japanese
looking for her.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.340
Yeah.

Why don't you wait a bit longer?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.540
But...

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.250
But how long do we have to wait?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.980
The train station is full of Japanese.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.250

But one is a woman.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.940
One is really old.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.420
The remaining one has always
stayed in the shared dormitory.

You just went in to check.

That beast Dashun

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.940

to the Japanese for money.

It's enough that one of us can survive.

Don't look back.

I've been waiting for you for ages.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.940
You finally came.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.940
A big star like you really is different.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.220
You look good in anything.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.940
Many prominent people have come today.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.940
I'll introduce you to them one by one.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.220
You don't even know

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.700
how hard it is to arrange
a meeting with Colonel Sasaki.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.220
It's really because you have clout.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:45.940
We're here.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.980
I won't go in with you.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.340
Mr. Takeda.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.220
Ms. Xian, you're here.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.220
Where's the Colonel?

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.460
It's not easy for you
to meet my superior.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.100
Just like it's not easy
for me to meet yours.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.850
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.980
That day I followed Joseph Lee
to Chaosheng Theatre.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.460
Joseph Lee vanished strangely

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.940
right under my nose.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.060
Later, our code was leaked.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.100
Joseph Lee said

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.220
he got the news from the British.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.100
On top of that,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.100
your ambiguous relationship
with Joseph Lee

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.180
makes me think

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.060
it's hard for me not to suspect

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.220
that the code was leaked

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.220
from you, Ms. Xian.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.940
If it was just that,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.500
I would only suspect you
of being an intelligence dealer.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.020
But that night during the test,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.980
both the Nationalists and Communists

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.140
set off air-raid sirens simultaneously.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.260
That has to make me doubt

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.860
your identity, Ms. Xian.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.460
Tell me,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.140
are you with the Nationalists

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.220
or the Communists?

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.620
Mr. Takeda.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.090
It's really a pity
you aren't a playwright

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.460
in our troupe.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:17.980
What?

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.460
Does this mean

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.900
you want to restrict my freedom?

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.220
Tell me,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.460
does Colonel Sasaki know
you're doing this?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.700
Whether you can see the Colonel

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.180
depends on whether
you choose to cooperate.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.290
I know there's a storm of change now.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.740
The British can't shield us anymore.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.940
But these two accusations

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.940
are far too heavy

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.900
for me to carry, Mr. Takeda.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.460
Bring the tea.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.330
Yes.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.980
Zhu Hongyu

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.050
has been captured.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.050
She has confessed.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.740
On the surface, you are a movie star.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.900
But in fact, you are a communist.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.460
The so-called Chaosheng Troupe

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.460
is nothing more

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.220
than a cover for your true identity.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.290
Hongyu is a communist?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.260
Impossible.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.460
Hongyu has always been timid.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.660
Maybe you tortured
a confession out of her.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.980
She's young and can't take the pain,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.220
so she bites others at random.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.370
Mr. Takeda,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.370
this trick

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.260
is far too childish.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.370
But Zhu Hongyu said

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.220
you have a handler

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.740
who is very mysterious,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.460
and has only been
to the troupe once or twice.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.290
You are the only one
in direct contact with him.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.940
Is that true?

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.700
Nonsense.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.700
People only come to the troupe
to see me for business.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.900
What do you mean "a handler"?

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.130
Ms. Xian, you should be aware

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.660
that now is the critical period
for Sino-Japanese peace talks.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.420
For a movie star as influential as you,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.370
we wouldn't act rashly

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.660
without solid evidence.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.980
This could be your last chance.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.420
If we wait until we have real evidence,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.180
there will be no room for negotiation.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.460
Ms. Xian,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.460
don't let this cup of tea become

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.020
the last one you ever drink here.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.740
Where is Hongyu?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.980
Where is Hongyu?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.740
Where is Hongyu?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.770
Speak up!

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.660
Where is Hongyu?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.260
Say something!

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.770
Run! Don't worry about me!

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.770
Ding Yi, go!

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.740
Let go of me!

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.500
Let go!

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.740
Ding Yi!

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.530
Are you even human?

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.900
I trusted you so much,

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.660
and you betrayed us!

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.330
You scum!

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.180
You beast!

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.980
I didn't mean to betray you.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.810
Ding Yi.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.050
I didn't mean to betray you.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.260
I didn't mean to.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.810
Jerk!

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.460
Jerk!

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.740
Beast!

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.220
I didn't mean to.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.180
Hongyu.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.740
Hongyu!

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.660
Ding Yi, I really didn't mean to.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.090
I've been poor for too long.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.420
I just wanted to make some money

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.700
and settle down in Shanghai.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.220
Hongyu!

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.740
I just wanted to live well.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.900
You became a traitor for the Japanese.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.260
That's living well?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.100
You wanted to live well,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.220
so you could harm your own friend

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.020
and betray your own people?

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.970
No, no.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.930
If everyone

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.980
was a coward like you,

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.740
then we'd be

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.810
not far from seeing our country fall

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.940
and our homes destroyed.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.420
No, that's not it.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.980
I'll make sure you remember

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.290
that Hongyu

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.500
wasn't killed by the Japanese.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.660
She was killed by you.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.260
It's raining.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.660
This tea is quite nice.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.810
May I have another cup?

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:51.090
Seems you won't give up
till disaster hits.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.940
You're still in the mood for tea?

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.680
[Melody of Spring]

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.500
Don't worry.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.220
Do you think you can just grab any book

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.740
and use it to convict me?

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.180
Hongyu's Party membership application

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.220
can be put on the agenda.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.600
[Applicant: Zhu Hongyu]

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.640
[Zhu Hongyu]

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.020
It is my will to join
the Communist Party of China,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.260
strictly observe the Party's discipline,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.050
be ready at all times
to sacrifice my all,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:28.330
and fight for communism until the end.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.740
Ms. Xian.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.330
Why are you so nervous?

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.770
Mr. Takeda,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.330
this joke has gone too far.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.290
Do you know what you're doing?

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.260
Don't you think this looks familiar?

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.810
How would I know?

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.980
I've never seen it before.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.460
Bring him up.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.050
Yes.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.050
Hongyu.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.180
Hongyu.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.050
Hongyu.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.530
Hongyu.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:33.660
Hongyu.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.500
Hongyu.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.020
It's time to go.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.770
Get lost!

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.660
I can't leave Hongyu here alone.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.900
It's too cold, too cold.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.220
Come back here.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.740
It's too cold!

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.460
Listen to me!

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.900
I'm telling you,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.980
she doesn't feel cold.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.180
She's dead!

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.290
Dead, do you understand? Dead!

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.290
She's not dead!

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.220
Hongyu.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.980
Hongyu!

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.740
Hongyu.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.570
Hongyu!

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.740
Come here.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.740
Go.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.290
It seems unless we use our trump card,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.260
you will not admit it.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.330
Zhao Fu.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.570
Ms. Xian.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.290
Leader Xian.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.900
You'd better confess.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.020
Repeat what you just said.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.290
Zhu Hongyu

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.090
is a communist.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.660
Back when we were in the troupe,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.180
she often made extreme
anti-Japanese remarks.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.330
Ms. Xian,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.460
in the whole troupe,

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.420
you and Hongyu were the closest.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.460
She told you everything.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.770
You must know all about her.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.940
Just confess!

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.060
Don't blame me.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.700
Hongyu...

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.370
She

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.330
deserves to die.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.090
Xian Biyun's enjoying VIP treatment
with the Japanese.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.300
She makes me do
all kinds of disgusting jobs!

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.220
Stop.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.090
Go collect the body of that
female communist Zhu Hongyu.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.570
No. 64 Jiaxing Road.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.370
Yes.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:27.810
Hurry, hurry.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.980
There's really no need

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.300
to drag down the whole troupe for her.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.540
Ms. Xian, just admit it.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.650
But, but...

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.850
But I'm really not a communist.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.090
You said you're not a communist,

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:14.740
yet first there's Joseph Lee's code
being leaked,

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.410
and then Zhu Hongyu being a communist.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.330
Both are closely connected to you.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.980
What else can you say now?

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.540
Hongyu...

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.220
She

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.220
deserves to die.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.500
So it seems Zhu Hongyu
really is a communist.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.780
If that's the case,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.610
fine.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.540
Bring that little girl out to me.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.220
I will confront her face to face.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.130
I want to see how this ungrateful wretch

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.610
dares to throw mud on me!

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.130
Hongyu came here as a refugee.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.060
She didn't have
many friends in Shanghai.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.540
But now that you mention it,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.090
I do remember

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.380
she seemed to have a cousin.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.460
I only remember

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.610
she called her cousin

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.690
Ruan Qing.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.900

No.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.460
Every time Zhu Hongyu went to see her,
she was very secretive.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.210
She never came to the troupe.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.820

She really exists.

But she's a death row prisoner.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.900
When the National Revolutionary Army
attacked Sun Chuanfang,

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.690
the prison holding her was shelled.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.650
The prisoners took the chance to riot,

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.380
allowing her to escape.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.650
There's no further record after that.
