[Asia's God of War]

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.540
But I've been behind the scenes
for many years,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.740
only wanting to focus on
managing my troupe.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.100
That's why Ms. Xian's comeback work

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
would attract even more attention.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.460
Everyone, let's take a group photo.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.660
Everyone, come together.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.980
Please look this way.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.660
I now solemnly announce,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.980
Ms. Xian Biyun

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.340
will serve as the Sino-Japanese

Hongyu.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.100
Have you really thought this through?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.260
Sacrificing your all

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.500
and fighting for communism until the end

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.780

If one day

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.220
the revolutionary cause forces you
to ruin your own reputation

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.250
and the troupe's future,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.020
would you hesitate?

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.730
Look at me.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.100
Look at me.

Three, two, one.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.370
Alright, done.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.490
Look this way.

Three, two, one.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.370
So, Mr. Takeda,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.340
didn't I handle this beautifully?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.460
You see,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.340
everything you instructed me to do
was done properly.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.460
Can we follow what we agreed before?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.250
Transfer Liang back to Shanghai?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.020
At present,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.340
there's no suitable position
here for Mr. Liang.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.340
If there's a vacancy, I'll let you know.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.020
Mr. Takeda.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.050
Mr. Takeda.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.900
Rumors of Liang
defecting to Chairman Wang

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.900
have already spread.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.140
He's currently in Suzhou.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.780
If the Chongqing Bureau finds out,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.340
and you don't arrange a job for him,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.700
Liang will die in Suzhou.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.900
That will depend on
Mr. Liang's own fate.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.340
Ms. Xian.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.460
There's one more thing I'd like to ask.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.340
How exactly was the code leaked?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.900
I'm afraid only the insiders of MSS

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.020
know how this code was designed.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.660
You're just trying to find fish

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.780
in a tree, aren't you?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.900
What I'm curious about is

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.700
how did the British

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.140
find out the code was leaked?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.780
My relationship with the British

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.700
is not so good that they'd tell me
the source of their intelligence

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.140
in full detail.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.580
Ms. Xian.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.700
You are

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.220
a socialite in Shanghai.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.140
The British,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.700
the Americans,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.460
the Chinese.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.900
They all show you respect.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.140
I suppose

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.220
you must have some extraordinary skills.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.460
Today, you took
the initiative to meet me.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.900
You must have come prepared.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.900
You

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.580
wouldn't casually reveal

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.140
unverified intelligence,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.140
would you?

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.580
Wait a moment.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.340
Perhaps you could help us analyze

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.540
where exactly the British

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.460
got their information from.

[Takeda]

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.930
If you truly wish to investigate,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.380
perhaps you should start from here.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.740
That's all I have to say.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.140
I will carefully read the script.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.140
Goodbye.

[New Asia Hotel]

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.500
Biyun, over here.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.890
I treated you as a friend.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.650
What do you mean by this?

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.410
Aren't you just acting in one more play?

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.890
Why so upset?

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.140
What do you take me for?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.290
Xian Biyun!

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.650
Now that you have the Japanese
as your backers,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.890
what losses could you possibly suffer?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.620
Today a communist was found
in your troupe.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.340
It's such a serious matter.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.100
If Mr. Takeda hadn't been there,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.620
would you have gotten away so easily?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.220
You're determined
to side with the Japanese?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.380
Right now, I can only side with them.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.500
Good. Very good.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.290
You and Liang can
side with them together.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.890
So it's fine for you to work
with the new government,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.380
but Liang isn't allowed?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.980
All because when he was young,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.380
he took part in student activities
organized by the communists.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.890
Those jerks in the BIS
give him a hard time every day,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.380
calling him a traitor who defected.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.140
In his whole life, Liang

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.740
has never suffered such humiliation.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.530
Don't blame me

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.570
about today's matter.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.500
Once I act as a go-between for you
and the new government

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.220
and make you the goodwill ambassador,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.690
he promised me

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.100
that he'll transfer Liang

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.380
back to Shanghai from Suzhou.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.380
But now,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.260
that old jerk has gone back on his word.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.890
He told me

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.500
there's no vacancy

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.740
and spread rumors about Liang
defecting to Wang.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.740
If the Chongqing Bureau finds out,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.260
Liang's life will be over.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.740
Biyun.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.290
You've known Liang for so many years,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.890
haven't you?

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.890
You can't stand by and watch him die.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.220
Biyun.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.740
I was wrong, Biyun.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.020
Please help me, okay?

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.740
I was wrong.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.740
Biyun.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.220
Enough.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.460
What's the use of saying this now?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.620
Help us.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.020
Didn't Takeda say

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.140
that with no vacancy,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.650
Liang can't return?

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.220
If someone is no longer around,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.020
there will be a vacancy.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.290
Is that what you mean?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.620
Hongyu.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.460
Don't ask anything.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.740
Don't say anything.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.740
Just help me get him

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.220
to China Hong Kong safely.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.770
Understood.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.260
I can't take this.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.500
Listen to me, take it.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.740
It's a long, dangerous trip.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.740
Let's keep things separate.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.380
I can't let you go for nothing.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.500
Thank you.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.500
I'll go get everything ready.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.740
Don't worry.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.140
I'll make sure he arrives safely.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.260
What are you doing?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.380
Stay back!

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.740
You're going to hand me over
to the BIS, aren't you?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.860
We're at...

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.260
Stay back.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.500
We're at the docks now.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.980
I'm here to get you out.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.980
I'm sending you to China Hong Kong.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.380
Stop lying to me!

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.380
Tell me,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.860
who is that man?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.860
He's the boatman. He's one of us.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.500
Tonight, you'll leave on his boat.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.500
Yeah, you're all "one of us".

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.740
None of you are good people!

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.500
Dashun traded me for money,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.220
and you're trading me for your future.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.980
You're definitely taking me back

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.980
to hand me over to your teacher,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.220
so he can blind me

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.380
to complete that so-called

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.500
Sword Thrust Operation.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.620
Isn't this what you're afraid of?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.220
If I really wanted to blind you,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.260
could you still be seeing things

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.860
when you just opened your eyes?

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.260
Come on.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.380
Look.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.380
We truly are at the docks.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.220
Behind that building

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.220
is the boat you'll be on tonight.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.500
I promised you.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.290
I will keep my word.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.980
No.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.570
I can't go yet.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.530
We don't know if Ms. Xian

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.860
and the troupe members
are alive or dead.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.500
I can't abandon them.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.860
Gu Yangshan,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.220
I want to stay for revenge.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.260
I can't let Hongyu die in vain.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.460
I want to stay by the Japanese

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.380
and kill them all!

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.380
Calm down. Calm down.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.220
Listen to me, okay?

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.530
I know you want revenge.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.140
But think about it.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.980
If you go back now, what can you do?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.500
You can't do anything.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.980
And didn't we agree

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.380
you'd go to China Hong Kong

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.220
to meet with your mother?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.740
Understand?

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.740
I'm not going.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.740
I want revenge.
I want to kill all the Japanese!

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.380
You...

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:00.980
Is it here?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.740
Yes.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.140
Our people are watching over there.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.980
Lead the way.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.220
Capture them alive.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.220
Come.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.500
Go.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.380
Go.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.340
Help me!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.980
Go!

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.220
Hurry!

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.220
Go, go!

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.980
Down here!

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:23.940
Go.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.330
Go.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.020
You go first!

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.500
Let's go together!

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.260
Now!

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.900
I'm not leaving!

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.740
Go!

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.330
Move quickly!

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.980
Go!

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.530
We should go together.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.740
Are you okay?

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.980
Get down, quickly!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.610
Run! Someone's coming!

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.420
I'll cover you! Go!

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.330
We go together!

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.660
This way, quickly!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.570
Go!

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.260
Hurry!

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.500
Go.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.260
Get on the boat!

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.980
Go!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.420
On the boat!

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.090
Go!

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.020
On the boat!

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.180
I'm not going!

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.700
Go!

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.420
Gu Yangshan!

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.900
Get on the boat!

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.020
I'm not going!

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.810
Let go of me!

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:51.570
Get on the boat first!

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.500
Gu Yangshan!

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.770
Gu Yangshan!

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.290
Get on the boat!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.260
Gu Yangshan!

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.810
Get on the boat!

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.290
Get on first!

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.570
Quick!

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.460
Why aren't you going?

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.700
We should go together!

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.500
Go, together!

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.940
Gu Yangshan, come up quick! Hurry!

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.180
You go first.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.020
There are too many of them.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.420
If we go together, it's suicide.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.940
I'll find you in China Hong Kong later.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.330
No!

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.940
Hongyu died before me

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.180
so I could leave.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.740
If you don't come, I won't go.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.660
At worst, we die together!

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.500
Sir, come with us.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.020
Li, go now!

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.460
Get him out of here, protect him well!

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.940
If you don't go, I'll shoot!

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.810
Go!

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.610
Go!

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.770
Gu Yangshan!

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.740
Hurry, go!

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.700
Gu Yangshan!

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.810
I lied to you about Baimahu.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.090
Nothing happened to your mother.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.460
I had someone print the newspapers

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.330
and record the broadcast.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.020
I'm just a liar.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.020
It is reported that

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.900
recently the Japanese army

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.770
has launched fierce offensives
in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.940
Three prongs of their forces
are about to encircle Baimahu.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.290
Baimahu.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.220
Baimahu is in peril.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.090
That's why the priority now

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.570
is to replace the enemy's
operational code.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.940
Only then can we

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.610
learn their battle plan

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.850
and turn things around.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.770
Then you'd be able to save your mother.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.740
I'm not a good man!

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.460
Ding Yi!

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.330
Live well in China Hong Kong!

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.180
I'm sorry!

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.570
I surrender.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.810
You jerk!

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.460
Quick, surround him!

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.420
No, no, no.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.940
Don't shoot.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.570
The man you want has already escaped.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.810
Move aside!

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.330
Move!

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.330
Where is he?

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.420
Where is he?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.700
Gone.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.810
You made me work for nothing.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.330
Li Boyao, this time,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.180
you will regret it.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.460
Trying to play me?

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.020
You think I wouldn't dare kill you?

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.600
Screw you.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.810
Shoot then.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.660
Do you dare?

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.050
You've gotten so arrogant.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.460
Stop!

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.660
Let him go.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.530
If you want money, trade me for it.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.570
Right now, in Shanghai,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.570
no one is worth more than me.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.220
Come here.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.090
My money.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.330
So tell me.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.940
What did you come to talk to me about?

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.940
I want to talk business with you.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.090
We're going to the military police,

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.370
or your brother-in-law's place?

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.330
What the Japanese want

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.940
is their good friend,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.460
the code expert Joseph Lee.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.130
Look at him now.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.940
This little punk in this state.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.540
Like half-dead.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.330
Unless the Japanese are blind,

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.500
they'll see at once he's an impostor.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.090
If I send him to the military police,

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.330
the Japanese will shoot him on the spot,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.980
and then trouble me

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.090
to send his body to the crematorium.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.220
How much did the Japanese offer you?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.020
Why are you asking this?

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:27.980
How much?

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.980
Five gold bars.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.260
Oh come on, Inspector Li.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.700
Have you been smoking opium

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.330
and fried your brain?

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.540
If your brain's so good,

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.780
would you risk offending both the BIS

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.780
and the Japanese for this little punk?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.940
Instead of enjoying your high position,

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.940
you just have to stir up this mess.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.460
I'd say your brain's much
worse than mine.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.610
Inspector Li.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.890
He's not some punk.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.370

I'd rather starve to death

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.060
than take that job.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.340
Right!

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.650
I won't take it either!

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.540
You think without you,

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.610
Chaosheng Troupe will collapse?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:36:59.900
The show can go on

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.540
without anyone.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.730
Just remember,

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.020
get out if you don't want to stay!

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.060
I won't dock your wages by a cent.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.730
Fine.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.130
No wonder before she was all

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.730
flirtatious with that Japanese manager.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.460
I knew something was off.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.540
So this is your true face.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.540
We've really been blind

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.540
to follow her so long.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.060
Watch your mouth.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.130
She's just a darn traitor!

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.730
Say that again.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.540
Traitor!

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.460
Say that again!

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.210
So what if I do?

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.940
She's a traitor!

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.820
What did you say?

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.540
Traitor!

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.570
If anyone dares cause trouble again,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.340
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.090
Get out, all of you!

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.130
Mulan Joins the Army.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.170
That show is over!

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.340
Go, all of you!

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.980
Darn traitor!

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.730
Pah.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.610
Traitor!

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.610
Pah!

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.500
Pah!

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.500
This is our home.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.610
Where are we supposed to go?

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.690
Ms. Xian.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.610
I know you're inside.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.610
I also know you and the Japanese
are mortal enemies.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.730
You must have

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.130
some unspeakable difficulties.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.730
Just tell me one truth.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.060
Are you and Hongyu

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.250
communists?

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.090
Whether Zhu Hongyu is a communist

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.130
has nothing to do with me.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.460
Don't ask me such silly questions again.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.610
Long Er, let's go.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.130
Mr. Wu.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.170
I am a wanderer.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.540
My eyes are sharp.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.650
So

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.540
I can tell you have your own plans.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.730
I've

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.610
worked hard in the troupe for so long,

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.860
hoping to gain your trust.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.420
I've been thinking that one day,

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.540
I could earn your approval

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.980
and help you with things.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.340
But overnight,

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.250
Hongyu is gone,

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.820
labelled a communist,

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.610
and you suddenly defect to the Japanese,

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.770
leaving me like a fool,

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:35.690
knowing nothing.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.170
Long Er,

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.090
you must know

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.540
the more you know,
the more dangerous it is.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.090
Then why can Ding Yi know?

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.860
He...

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.340
In what way is he
more trustworthy than I am?

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:50.540
Hongyu wasn't afraid of sacrifice,

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.650
I am not afraid either.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.130
Long Er, leave.
Everything's been arranged.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.540
Go.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.090
I'm not going, Mr. Wu.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.460
This is my home. I'm not leaving.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.940
I'm not.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.250
This troupe

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.170
is your life's work.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.020
Would you rather we all scatter,

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.170
the troupe disbanded,

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.090
and you alone bear an eternal infamy,

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.130
than tell me one truth?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.170
You saved my life.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.820
Even if you are a communist,

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.130
I wouldn't betray you.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.540
Just tell me one truth,

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:36.540
just one.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.940
If you say it, I'll believe you.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.730
If you want to find communists,
go elsewhere.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.250
Hasn't Zhu Hongyu

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.940
already brought us enough misery?

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.610
Get out!

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.730
I didn't expect

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.060
that after all my effort,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.090
I wouldn't even deserve one answer.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:22.730
Long Er.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.060
What are you doing?

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.130
These three bows

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.060
are to return your favor

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.090
for saving my life.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.980
As for the answer,

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.170
I'll find it myself.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.340
