[The Tower of Whispers]

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.360
[Episode 3]

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.079
Hurry up!

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.160
Stop!

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.140
Get up! Get up now!

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.590
No. 5! Get up now!

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.630
Why did he stop?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.370
Young man, what's going on?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.150
What are you doing?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.360
Why did he stop?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.960
Miss, what displeased you?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.150
He didn't deserve

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.840
such a quick death.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.520
I want to buy him.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.560
Before you die,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.910
I will return all the suffering

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.640
I endured in my past life to you.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.750
Why is he chained up?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.680
I don't know.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.900
What's happening?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.690
He must have offended someone.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.560
My Lady,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.360
why did you chain him up outside?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.680
There are many people watching
on the street.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.910
Are we going too far?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.240
I want him to taste

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.150
the feeling of being humiliated in public.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.000
[Lu's Mansion]

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
My Lady, I'll get you a mounting block.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.630
No need.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.310
You, come here.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.840
Kneel.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.250
Hold out your hands.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.260
Clean the blood off yourself
before coming in.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.950
[Lu's Mansion]

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.830
You're filthy.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.480
That's my residence ahead.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.750
From now on,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.450
whether it's windy, rainy,
or freezing cold,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.950
your residence

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.520
is right on this floor beneath my feet.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.160
Be a good watchdog for me.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.680
Master,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.270
please give me a name.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.270
Why does a slave need a name?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.230
The arena owner called you No. 5,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.120
so I'll call you Five from now on.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.180
Thank you, Master.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.070
The snow...

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040
In my past life,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.560
the first time I met Jun Che,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.630
he made me kneel in the snow all night.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.500
If you want to thank me,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.600
do it sincerely.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.450
Thank me on your knees.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.630
Thank you, Master.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.120
Shut up!

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.270
Yan Hui,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.070
I would be better off dead.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.120
I'm just like a walking corpse now.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.560
Can Yan Hui bring you back from the dead?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.950
If I catch you writing
to another man again,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.680
Let it go!

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.430
I'll break your wings myself!

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.750
My Lady, what happened?

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.159
Bring me the horsewhip.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.560
You killed my pigeon,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.950
and prevented me
from sending letters home.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.720
You imprisoned me while I was alive,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.630
and wouldn't let me go even after I died.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.240
Cutting you into a thousand pieces

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.300
wouldn't ease the hatred in my heart.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.360
Master, it's just a baby

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.490
and nearly freezing to death.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.830
Please save it.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.560
Call someone.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.830
Compared to my suffering,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.100
this is merely a drop in the ocean.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.680
I won't let you die easily.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.210
[Lu's Mansion]

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.480
My Lady,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.840
he looks seriously injured.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.169
Should we call a doctor?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.240
He defeated so many people.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.370
He won't die easily.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.080
But My Lady,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.750
your cloak is still on him.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.030
Should I get it back?

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.910
He has made it dirty.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.970
Just leave it here.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.550
So noisy.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.970
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.870
Come on.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.670
Eat slowly.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.440
Come on, drink.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.870
You're annoying.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.600
I'm filthy rich.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.390
Thank you, sir.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.360
Murder!

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.350
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.360
Chief Commander.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.000
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600
Get up.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.570
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:36.860
Chief Commander.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.510
[Sang Li, a witch from Yue State
and Jun Che's trusted aide]

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.200
Let us handle these scum.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.530
You don't have to deal with them yourself.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.750
I've found a new hideout.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.440
This arena is no longer useful.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.700
Sang Li, clean this place up thoroughly.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.390
The most important thing now

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.550
is to lie low

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.860
and bide our time.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.840
[Wen, Jun Che's trusted aide]

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.790
People from all factions will gather

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.970
at the Crown Prince's
investiture ceremony.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.390
[Those near are won over,
and those far away come to join]

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.150
The situation will certainly be complex.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.150
It's a perfect opportunity for us
to observe covertly

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.480
and move in for the kill.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.670
Chief Commander.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.790
Will you be staying

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.390
by that noble lady from the Lu family

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.850
to conceal your identity?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.750
Lu Yingying doesn't seem

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.510
to be a docile lady.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.240
Are you sure about this?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.960
But I think

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.890
she's quite interesting.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.550
[Lu's Mansion]

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.870
Why did he recover so quickly?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.210
Where have you been?

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360
Oh, it is here.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.730
I've been looking for it everywhere.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.290
Why is there blood on your clothes?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.440
It's from

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.320
an old wound.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.590
It's nothing.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.670
An old wound? Here?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.910
Does it hurt?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.980
Take off your clothes.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.000
Take it off!
