[The Tower of Whispers]

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.360
[Episode 4]

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.010
Take off your clothes.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.000
Take it off.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.870
Put it on.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.430
You're injured, so stay put.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.630
Don't wander around.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.960
This matter is definitely not that simple.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.420
If he can't be controlled,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.430
should I still keep him?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.870
Yingying,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.870
why do you look so troubled today?

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.150
I think I've made a mistake.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520
What happened?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.310
Master,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.210
Cai Ping said you were looking for me.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240
We'll talk later.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.400
Yingying,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.430
who is he?

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.990
He's a slave I bought yesterday.

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:51.680
A slave?

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.770
You're from the Yue State.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:57.630
My Lord,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.800
last night at dawn,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.190
there was a murder at the arena.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.050
The entire scene was burned down.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.910
This needle contains Datura poison.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.040
We suspect someone from the Yue State.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.420
Where were you at dawn last night?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.360
My Lady.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.390
My Lady,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.920
someone came to visit.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.800
Madam asks you and Young Master
to the courtyard.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.120
I'm talking to you.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.890
Brother,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.480
Mother is looking for us.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.510
Let's go first.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.000
Sister,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.070
let me have a look at you.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.430
Aunt?

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.190
Why have you lost so much weight?

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.040
Why did she still come?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.110
It truly breaks my heart.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.840
[Li Huiwen, Lu Yingying's Aunt]

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.000
In my previous life,
after my father was imprisoned,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.659
Aunt seized the Lu's Mansion,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.330
and forced my mother to remarry,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.000
[Lu's Mansion]

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240
causing us to be separated.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.920
Could it be that capturing Ding Huairen

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.360
is not enough to change
our previous predicament?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.750
Your favorite treats.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.750
Take a look.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.180
We're sisters. You don't need to do this.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.680
Cai Ping,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.240
be more attentive.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.570
Come take this quickly.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.600
You can't even handle this properly.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.200
Wasting my good intentions.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.310
These ones still in the box

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.310
are still edible.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.720
What's this on top?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.390
It's all moldy

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.630
and growing fuzz.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.430
Someone might
mistake it for fermented tofu.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.240
Aunt,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.750
I wonder how long
you've kept these pastries.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.950
Weren't they bought
specifically for my mother?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.120
I was thinking

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.270
that Sister likes these pastries,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.240
but I didn't realize
the journey was so long

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.750
that they would spoil.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.680
Mother, doesn't she know

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.340
that you hate sweets the most?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.310
Or perhaps

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.480
sending this box of moldy pastries

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.240
is meant to humiliate
your sister who's better off than you.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.310
What did I do wrong

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950
for you to judge me like this?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.810
How about this?

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.560
Why don't you eat these pastries?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.390
If you eat them,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.990
I won't suspect you anymore.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.750
Yingying.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.560
Yan Hui! Yan Hui!

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.430
Yingying.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.430
Sister.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.920
Alright.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.560
I'll take you to rest in the backyard.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.090
Let's go.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.070
Go back now.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.160
Aunt, we'll settle our score later.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.390
Report!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.310
Lord Ding is here!

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.930
I forgot to tell you.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.160
The matter with Ding Huairen

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.020
has been resolved by Consort Yun.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.270
They're both here.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.720
Then what happened in the previous life

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.120
might happen again.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.240
What?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.070
[Act with Integrity]

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.240
Sister-in-law,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.310
what happened before
was just a misunderstanding.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.510
I hope you can forgive me.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.640
Don't worry, Lord Ding.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.120
However,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.870
thanks to my daughter Yingying
for this matter,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.120
otherwise, my husband

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.920
would be in prison now.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.170
These two were partners
in crime in their past life.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.970
I can't believe
they're already in cahoots now.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.370
Lord Ding, your visit at this time

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.159
is to show off

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.830
[Act with Integrity]

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.270
that you've been released from prison?

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.830
You misunderstand, niece.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.950
I was just passing by your residence

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.550
and stopping by to say hello.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.000
Since Lord Lu isn't here,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.680
I won't disturb you.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.070
[Act with Integrity]

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.920
Sister,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.430
I'm tired from my long journey.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.510
I'll go rest now.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.190
Alright.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.440
[Act with Integrity]

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.480
If they conspire against my family again,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.560
wouldn't I

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.560
fall into Jun Che's hands?

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.510
You rascal, let go of me!

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.510
What's the rush?

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.840
I've missed you so much.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.630
If you're so capable,
make our relationship public here.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.430
You smell so good.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.420
I'm tired of sneaking around like this.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.720
Once I get rid of Lu Yang,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.240
the remaining ones in the Lu family

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.390
will be at our mercy.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.920
The Lu's Mansion
will be ours sooner or later.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.360
Hurry.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.480
Get in the carriage now
and let me take good care of you.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.560
Then I'll try fighting poison with poison.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.360
I need you to do something for me.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.510
You are my master.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.200
Feel free to command me.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.000
Then no matter what I say,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.950
you'll do it?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.760
Of course.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.120
Through fire and water,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.050
I won't hesitate.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.780
Come with me.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.909
Do you see that carriage?

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.080
Overturn it.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.880
Be careful. Move inside.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.240
Make way!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240
Get out of the way!

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.640
Move aside quickly!

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.000
Move!
