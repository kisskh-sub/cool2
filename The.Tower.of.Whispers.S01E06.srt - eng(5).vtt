[Episode 6]

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.750
My Lord, you also like the scent

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.680
of the cosmetics I'm wearing, huh?

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.550
My Lord, what do you mean by this?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.240
There's the poison of Datura
on this needle.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.910
We suspect
someone from the Yue State did it.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.240
Haven't you said I'm very fond of

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.640
the scent of the cosmetics you're wearing?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.970
Would women from the Central Plains
use highly toxic Datura

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.360
as cosmetics?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.520
You women from the Yue State

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.430
must know little about the vocabulary
of our Central Plains.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.910
Let me teach you a phrase.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.450
This is called "digging your own grave."

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.720
My Lord, you really don't know
how to treat a lady kindly.

My Lord!

Where's the woman in a red dress
who just came out?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.150
I don't know. I didn't see her.

My Lady, I've changed into the clothes
you gave me.

I'll go boating with my parents later.

You've been cooped up
in the mansion for too long.

Okay.

more often in the future.

Don't forget our grand plan.

It's cold poison.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.950
After consumption, it'll cause weakness
in 4 limbs with bone-chilling cold.

And the victim will be unable to speak.
