and I don't like
having a knife pointed at me.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.240
Brother, you've really misunderstood.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.510
I asked him to come.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.770
Five, I'm warning you.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.670
You're just our family guard.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.080
Know your place,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.470
and stay away from Yingying from now on.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.840
Didn't I tell you?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.670
I invited him to watch the fireworks.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.150
It's true. Trust me.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.720
Yingying,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.790
the city isn't safe lately.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.480
There have been many murders.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.600
Don't go out this late anymore.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.150
Alright.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.490
I got it, Brother.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.470
[Lu's Mansion]

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.790
Yingying!

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.000
Father, Mother.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.960
Where have you been so late?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.320
I've been so worried.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.720
It's so dangerous for a young girl.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.080
Why are you still waiting for me so late?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.790
It's cold. Let's go inside.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.200
So you know it's late.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.900
You know your parents
are worried about you?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.240
Father, Mother, don't worry.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.910
I'm fine. I'm safe.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.600
Was she

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.480
with Five all day?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.080
Father, no.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.240
When I found her,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.730
she was setting off fireworks
with Cai Ping.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.120
Father, Mother, let's go inside.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.480
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.440
It won't happen again.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.510
You're not allowed
to come home this late anymore.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.150
Let's see if you dare do it again.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.030
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.760
Your mother even cried for you.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.960
It's okay, Brother.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.480
Five's martial arts are excellent.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.200
I'm very safe with his protection.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.570
