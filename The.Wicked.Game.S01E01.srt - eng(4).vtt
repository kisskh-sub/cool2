WEBVTT

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.020
Thank you all very much
for attending the press conference

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.210
on our Mercy Angel project.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.670
Let me assure you that
this is another step in our progress

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.350
to upgrade our treatment
so that it is accessible to patients everywhere

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.400
with our medevac service
to transport patients in emergencies.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.240
And with our professional staff,

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.550
I believe that we can create
new standards of treatment

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.280
to give hope and better quality of life

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.400
to everyone in our society.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.630
I'm just paving the way for my children.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.200
I've worked for a long time.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.910
-I'll probably retire soon.
-Yes.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.360
I assume it can only be Chet,
your eldest son, who will take over.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.850
You're too kind, sir.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.110
There are many things
I still have to learn from you and my dad.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.690
But I'm ready to take over if my dad approves.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.940
All right, let's go talk in the conference room.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.300
-That's a good idea.
-Please.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.550
-Let's go.
-Please.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.370
Why don't you join them, Ms. Risa?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.800
This project is your idea.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.040
You shouldn't let Chet take the credit.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.620
Thank you all very much

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.470
for helping Thanavejâ€™s profit

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.320
grow more than I even expected.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.970
To Thanavej.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.900
Hello, Dad.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.829
Why are you all quiet?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.960
Aren't you happy I'm back?

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.780
Why don't you applaud?

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.980
I guess I'm just in time.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480
Come here.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.270
I'll introduce you to the shareholders.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.570
Everyone,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.390
this is Pheem,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.820
my youngest son.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.040
Please guide me.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.050
To our Thanavej.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.580
How did you come back?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.909
I flew here of course.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.300
Don't be a smartass.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.080
Ever since you left,
I've never seen Dad show interest in you.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.570
Why are you so angry?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.740
It's been a while since we were all together.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.650
You should be happy.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.030
I don't consider a bastard like you as family.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.200
-Chet.
-Butt out!

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.540
What's going on?

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.100
I was the one who sent for Pheem.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.080
But he was fine living in Singapore.
Why did you send for him?

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.560
We needed the director of strategic planning.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.640
So I had Pheem come back to help.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.430
Pheem.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.160
Follow me to my office.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.800
Chet,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.120
I think it's worrying that Dad sent for Pheem.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.570
Worry about yourself first.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.730
He already got a higher position than yours.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.890
Hurry!

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720
Hurry!

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.540
Mom!

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.940
Mom!

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.850
You thought I'd let you people
take everything that belongs to Chet?

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.770
Huh?

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.960
Who dares stand in my son's way...

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.750
must die.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.790
Mom!

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.650
Mom!

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.130
Mom!

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.440
Please don't hurt me.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.900
Please don't hurt me.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.810
Please don't hurt me.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.740
Mom.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.630
Mom.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.800
Pheem!

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.030
Come on, or you'll miss your flight.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.990
Mom.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.350
Here, Mr. Chet.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.790
Mr. Pheem made many real estate
investments in Singapore.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.150
He has a partner to help with ownership documents.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.520
It seems he hasn't spent Mr. Thanet's money at all.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.800
What the hell.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.790
Holding real estate worth only 10 million baht.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.450
But why did Dad send for him?

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.870
There's a rumor he's going to retire.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.110
Calling Mr. Pheem back here, maybe he's...

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.930
No.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.870
No way.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.310
There's no way a bastard like him
will take over the business.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.590
The business my parents built.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.810
Who is he?

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.510
He thinks he can just take it?

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.810
Park.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.260
Look into it for me

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.940
why the bastard is back.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240
I will, Mr. Chet.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.970
Yes?

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.200
I'm on my way.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.630
Mister? Mister?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.230
Are you okay?

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.340
I'm fine.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.240
Nice car.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.650
Nice face.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.200
Why isn't your driving nice like your car?

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.220
You drove without consideration of others.
What's the hurry?

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.110
Do you have a driver's license?

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.880
I'm sorry.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.750
You're okay, right?

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.120
Don't touch me like we're friends.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.450
Don't try to befriend me.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.620
Of course I'm not okay.
My bike's over there. I'm over here.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.410
A little further, my head would've been in the sand.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.440
Thankfully I had a helmet on.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.340
Or you'd be charged with negligent homicide.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.330
Black Tea, my boy.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.040
Your kid was on the bike?

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.960
Mister, I'm standing here, my bike is here.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.960
By "my boy," I meant my bike.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.520
I just bought it. You're the first one.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560
I figured.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.060
What?

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.450
You cut me off on purpose to seek damages.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.560
Tell me how much you want.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.040
Hey, Mister.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.820
You're lousy at driving and you have a foul mouth.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.060
You're insulting me.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.760
So you don't want money?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I do.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.280
What's so funny?

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.460
What's that smirk? Don't play dumb. Think.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.640
You're in the wrong, so you have to pay.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.760
Okay, I'll call the cops to sort this out.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.840
Why would you do that?

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.630
If you do, I have to pay them too.
It's a waste of time.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.900
Hey, if I was recording you,
you would get two charges.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.960
One, reckless driving, almost causing my death.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.080
Two, insulting police officers,
disrespecting Thai police.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.600
Not all of them are bad. Don't generalize.
Wait for the cops here.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.350
I'm in a hurry.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.160
Just tell me how much you want.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.170
So I can get this over with.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.200
Don't think money can solve everything.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.670
Let's wait for the cops here. What's the rush?

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.350
Hey, where are you going?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.040
I don't like getting touched. Got it?

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.000
Don't you know? Huh?

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.710
Tried to run?

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.630
-Get off me!
-Stay still!

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.520
-Get off me!
-Hey!

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.600
You hit me and tried to run. So irresponsible.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.040
Wait for the cops with me here.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.850
I was just going to my car
to get my phone and call the insurance company.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.330
To sort this out.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:38.690
Get off me!

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.100
Don't try anything.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:44.990
Hurry. It's hot.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.620
Hey, Mister!

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.520
Hey!

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.940
Get in touch with me, Mr. Scammer.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.760
What do you mean? Hey, wait!

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.070
Hey, where are you going?!

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.050
Hey!

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.560
1KW7809!

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.240
I'll charge you with everything!
This is a hit and run!

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.010
I'm back, Mom.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.290
How was it seeing those people again?

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.590
The same.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.750
Realizing people like them manage a hospital,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.000
in charge of people's fates,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.200
makes me incredibly sad.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.200
I don't agree with what you're about to do.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.840
Kanya, my sister, entrusted me with you.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.500
If she knew you involved yourself
with those people again,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.140
she would be heartbroken.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.760
She should be happy.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.950
That I saw them again.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.760
So what now?

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.230
Thanavej must be mine.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.010
I will replace Chet as the successor to the hospital.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.590
That asshole...

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.200
won't have anything left.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.800
As for the father who abandoned me,

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.020
I will show him that I'm...

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.620
the right person to take over the hospital from him.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.599
I'm back to take everything...

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.819
from the people who caused my mom's death.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.910
Why did you call us here?

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.840
I will demolish this property.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.970
I want you guys to imagine this land.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.920
There will be a luxurious housing estate

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.760
along with a comprehensive health care center,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.680
providing in-depth health screening,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.490
anti-aging systems, stress management,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.100
as well as the fitness and spa zone
with cutting-edge technologies.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.720
Is it your new project?

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.960
Yes.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.180
Thanavej Wellness Center.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.160
I will focus on the VVIP customers,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.080
which are elderly people.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.240
And we will take care of their health from the moment
they wake up to the moment they go to bed.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.240
So it's a project to extort the last of the rich's money.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.060
Good, I like it.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.750
It's really you.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.490
I called you guys here...

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.240
because I'm looking for someone
to supervise this project.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.280
Last time, I supervised the cancer treatment center.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.040
-I think this time...
-I said I'm looking.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.280
Not asking for a volunteer.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.330
I'm sorry.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.270
It sounds like a very big project.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.810
Gonna need a lot of capital.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.880
Yes.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.480
This project requires a major capital raising.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.920
That means

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.710
whoever helps me supervise this project...

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.350
must be squeaking clean

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.290
and has no scandals.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.240
Or the project's branding will be damaged.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.030
Which could cause a problem in future funding.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.280
You two understand, right?

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.000
Yes, Dad.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260
Yes.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.240
As for you,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.440
just help me observe how Chet and Pheem work.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840
Sure.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.440
This wellness center project is huge.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.600
Whoever gets to supervise it...

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.380
Gets my dad's complete trust.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.800
The person who gets this project will be his successor.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.720
Then your dad shouldn't keep you out of the running.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.420
He's never noticed his daughter, Pan.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.810
(Pheem Yotsinphaisan)

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.340
Go back to Singapore.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.160
You don't belong here.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.430
Not yet.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.930
But soon, every square inch of this place...

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.040
will be mine.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.680
Dream on.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.340
A bastard like you is just wet trash.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.080
Last time I took you and your mom down.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.230
This time I will make you crawl away like a dog.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.640
Last time?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.730
The one who did that was your mom.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.440
Not you.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.950
You don't know how to get things done.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.810
Mark my word.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.830
I'm Dad's only son.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.490
I will inherit everything from him.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.390
Wake up.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.200
I don't think Dad agrees.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.410
Or he wouldn't have sent for me.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.320
Pheem!

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.240
Mr. Chet, don't.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.130
You have no idea what I can do to you.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.240
And you have no idea...

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.750
what this guy called Pheem...

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.480
is capable of.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.280
I'm not the Pheem you used to know.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.450
Pheem!

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480
We should go.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.460
Than.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.490
I bet he's a scammer. Definitely.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.050
No need to ask them. It's a waste of time.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.370
Then great, so you can arrest him.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.300
Hello, could you please check

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.380
if there's someone by this name here.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.090
Sure.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.960
I see.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.850
The director left something for you.
Just a moment, please.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.000
"The director"?

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120
Here.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.390
(Pay: Cash
The Sum of: One hundred thousand baht)

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520
Yes.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.120
Please take care of it, Ms. Oom.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.700
Thank you.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.370
Oh, Mr. Scammer.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.300
Here for the check?

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.390
I left it at reception.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.190
I know.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040
What?

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:52.330
Is it too little?

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.180
Hey.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.880
It's too much.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.930
Keep your check.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.290
Medical and bike repair receipts.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.250
9,500 baht in total.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.800
That's all I need.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.350
Keep it.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.480
Consider it my kindness.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.030
Hold on.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:25.180
If I keep this check, I will be admitting
that your insult toward me is true.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.590
Why do you think I insulted you?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680
The thing is

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.720
the two of us

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.670
are just strangers.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.560
I don't even know your name.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.660
Why would I waste your brain insulting you?

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.410
I have better things to do.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.550
I don't want to know you either.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.620
I don't mind you calling me a nobody, so...

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.080
here are the medical and bike repair receipts.
It's 9,500 baht. That's all I need.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.170
Transfer the money.
So we won't see each other again.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.380
And let me tell you something.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.830
Even though I'm not rich like you,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.740
I don't do everything for money.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.070
You're...

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.380
interesting.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.150
Wake up. You think
you're the lead in superhero comics?

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.120
Open your bank's app. I'll transfer the money.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.660
How much again?

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.460
9,500 baht.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.200
Khomthanwa Koetkasin.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.530
9,500 baht.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.430
Thank you.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.780
Happy now, right?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.440
Hey.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.160
Let me tell you something.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.600
People like you

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.240
are either allergic to the power of money

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.620
or starving to death with your stupid pride.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.550
Bye.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:06.220
â™ª Please be patient when you date someone poor â™ª

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.080
â™ª Ignore how people look at us â™ª

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:15.450
â™ª Don't feel blue when we lose â™ª

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:22.120
â™ª Don't say goodbye just because we face a problem â™ª

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.960
â™ª Stand by me and give me a smile â™ª

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.820
â™ª Be a drug that heals this poor man's heart â™ª

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.570
Very good. Very good.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.150
Let's eat.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.670
I'm starving. What's for dinner?

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.100
-I'm starving too!
-There's plenty of food.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.030
Here you go.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.090
By the way, bro,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.650
you still sing really well.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.710
Honestly, I think you should enter
a singing contest with a cash prize.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.080
I bet you'll win.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.960
Boss, don't encourage him.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.330
If he does something crazy on TV,

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.110
Iâ€™ll cringe for his mom.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.360
Phaen, you're dragging my mom into this?

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.370
I should be doing worse than that, idiot!

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.430
Someone gave you 100k, but you returned it

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.070
instead of stocking your shop.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.670
Isn't the opening next week?

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.090
Yeah.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.430
You have to help me cook, Phaen.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.370
Hey, I'm a police detective, not chef.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.940
But your food's amazing.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.190
And I'm thinking about
giving free food on the opening day.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.150
Invite people from the station, Boss.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.360
You got it, chief. I'll take care of it.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.230
But I'll be honest with you.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.800
Ever since you left us,

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:46.880
our station...

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:52.990
Boss.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.250
Boss!

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.870
Than is still here. He's not dead.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.770
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.820
You should be an actor instead of a cop.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.290
Really, I have the talent?

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.570
No.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.080
Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.790
Let's just eat!

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.700
Bottoms up!

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.940
Let me tell you something.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.390
People like you

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.860
are either allergic to the power of money

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.680
or starving to death with your stupid pride.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.010
(Police Captain Khomthanwa Koetkasin)

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:28.920
Where are you going?

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.840
What's this?

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.390
You're caught red-handed.
What do you have to say?

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.360
This money is not mine. I didn't do it.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.570
I've been watching you for a while.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.410
I'm really disappointed in you.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.530
I'm disappointed in you too, Chief.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.020
Fine.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.800
You said you didn't do it.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.540
I'll set up a committee to investigate you.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.320
But during the investigation,

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.250
you have to resign.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600
(Detective)

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.760
You got here just a few days ago,

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.860
but you already cut a lot of unnecessary expenses.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.120
Can I take over this place from you?

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.240
I'm good at digging.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.660
You know that.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.240
You think you can use what I did in the past

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.160
to threaten me into giving you this place?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.910
I had everything taken care of.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.080
Nothing can incriminate me.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.420
I know, Dad,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.840
that these documents can't hurt you.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.800
But they're enough to get your attention

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.310
and make you let me work here, right?

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.790
You want my position?

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.650
Yes, Dad.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.150
Chet still has more experience.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.400
But if you want it,

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.030
prove yourself to me

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.240
that you are worthy.

I don't know, auntie.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.530
Why?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.790
Is there a problem with these documents?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.910

Fentanyl.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.360
It's a severe pain reliever.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.640
Mostly used in cancer patients suffering from pain.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.480
It's a restricted drug.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.260
Only doctors can prescribe it

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.220
because it's addictive.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.660
People who take it will feel drowsy and relaxed.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.560
Isn't the timing too good?

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.610
Your father just said the other day

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.660
the person with a scandal will be tossed aside, right?

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.490
And these documents came to you today.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.230

(Natthawut Sakunyot, Chief Pharmacist)

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.210
Drugs are normally dispensed
according to prescriptions.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.820
In this case, the drug might be damaged

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.330
and wasn't reported, so there's a discrepancy.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:22.160
Or it might have been borrowed by another branch.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.840
Because our hospital has many branches.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.640

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.860
Yes.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.790

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.190
remain unfixed next time,

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.120

I did a search. Someone died
from fentanyl a few years back.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.870
It must've come from our hospital.

They tried to kill you.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.630
They failed.

What are you looking at?

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.520
Just got lost in thought.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.610
You know my name.

I don't know yours.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.320
You don't need to know.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.410
You said yourself

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.230
that we were just strangers.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.060
That was before.

This time you saved my life.

Of course I want to know.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.710
So I can repay you.

Nice to meet you.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.510
But it's not nice for me.

You come with trouble.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.920
But do you have any idea who those guys are?

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.660
Not a clue.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.350
I must have offended someone,

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.760
so they sent them to greet me.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.880
But that was just a warning.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.550
Because if they were serious,

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:56.680
I would've died.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.680
That was a violent greeting.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.010
You didn't do anything bad, right?

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.630
Why are you so good?

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.090
Where did you learn to fight?

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.020
Buakaw or Rodtang?

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.850
Sword and stick fighting.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.340
I learned in junior high.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.560
Sword and stick fighting?

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.800
Why don't you go wash up?

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.130
You're soaked.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.500
You'll get sick.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:41.870
I'm worried.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:49.510
Thank you.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:16.430
What?

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.740
I'm going in.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.070
Hey.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.880
What do you want?

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.510
Your clothes.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.500
You wanna wash them yourself
or you want me to do it?

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.950
I'll wash them myself.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.850
Hey.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.400
Let me do it.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.710
I have a washer and a dryer.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.040
So you can wear them right after.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.960
Just a sec.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.230
I'm gonna take a shower.

You're exactly what I'm looking for.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200
Wanna be with me?

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.840
I mean do you wanna come work for me?

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.640
Do you know why executives
in our organization don't hold stock options?

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:13.720
I won't spare anyone who takes Pheem's side.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.920
Captain Khomthanwa.
He's not interested in working for me.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.170
But he should interest you.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:21.500
Did you know what case he was on
right before getting fired?

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:24.530
