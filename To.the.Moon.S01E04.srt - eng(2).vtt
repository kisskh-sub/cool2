(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.980
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.380
What's going on? It's so crowded.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.990
Where is she, though?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.760
What?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.520
Hey, Kim Ji Song!

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.530
What're you doing?
Why didn't you get on?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.000
You're such a traitor.
You said you'd never do crypto!

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.230
Well, things just kind of...

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.030
That's why I'm telling you
to just get on.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.130
No way.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.300
What if it's even worse
than the torment we're in now?

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.870
What could be worse than the torment
we're already in?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.740
- No way. I'm not going.
- Come on!

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.910
The train will be departing shortly.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.080
All passengers,
please take your seats...

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.390
- and fasten your seatbelts.
- Hey, the train's about to leave!

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.520
I'm not going. I'm not!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.160
I'm not going. I'm not!

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.360
Hey... Hey, Ji Song!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.170
Welcome, passengers.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.610
Our train has departed
from a miserable reality...

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.540
where the value of your labor
goes unappreciated.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.640
What?

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.680
Eun Sang, what is all this?
Are you cosplaying?

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.480
There is a slight risk of injury
during our journey.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.990
Injury?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.690
Ouch, that stings!

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.990
What? A mark from a 20 percent loss.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.460
- You're already down?
- Down?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.800
Still, you've got it easy.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.760
See that guy over there?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.530
He's down 30,000 dollars.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.800
And that woman over there.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.300
She's down 40,000 dollars.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.570
And me...

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.210
What's wrong? Are you okay?

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.010
Fifty... I just lost 50,000 dollars.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.080
Oh my gosh!

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.820
Eun Sang, stop the train!
Someone's hurt here!

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.780
No! We can't stop!

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.250
No, this thing can't stop.
Just keep going.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.460
That's right!
Let's ride this out to the end!

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.830
- Yes, I agree.
- Yes, I agree.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.430
- I agree.
- I agree.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.230
- I agree.
- I agree.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.000
Our train will not leave
anyone behind...

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.100
and will go
to our final destination, the moon.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.640
So I suggest you brace yourselves.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.910
- What's that?
- Why did the light go out?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.240
And the consequences of your choices
are yours and yours alone.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.720
- Gosh.
- What is this?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.420
- When did we get here?
- Ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.930
You can do it! Ganbare!

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.990
Jiayou!

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.200
Let's all shout it together.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.630
To the moon!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.930
Let's go! Let's go!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.500
To the moon!

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.870
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.610
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.210
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.980
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.510
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.050
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.650
- Like you mean it!
- To the moon!

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.820
- Louder! To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.850
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.450
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.920
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.760
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.330
- To the moon!
- Moon...

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.060
- To the moon!
- Moon!

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.260
- To the moon!
- Moon...

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.770
- To the moon!
- Open the door!

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.870
Moon...

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.000
Da Hae!

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.040
Gosh, what are you doing?
I said open the door! The door!

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.670
- Hey!
- Oh, right.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.770
I forgot Mom was coming. Shoot.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.350
(Episode 4:
The Reason I Want to Be Rich)

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.400
Mom, come over here.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.570
Look.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.110
It's the threshold.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.840
There is a threshold!

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.220
No way. It's really going up.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.960
What are you staring at?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.990
What? Oh, it's nothing.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.230
So? It's not too shabby, right?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.860
I guess I didn't do too bad a job
raising you.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.570
You must've worked so hard
to be living in a place like this.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.070
- I'm so proud of you, sweetie.
- Oh, come on. It's no big deal.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.770
You're staying for dinner, right?

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.140
- Just whip something up.
- Okay.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.240
So what are all these boxes?

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.110
Oh, just stuff I'm throwing out.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.580
Just some books
I don't read anymore,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.650
and old photos from my childhood.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.950
What?
Why would you throw away photos?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.750
If there's no space, hang them up.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.750
Okay.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.690
What? What's that?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.260
No, Mom, don't! You can't use nails!

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.600
- No!
- You scared me. What's wrong?

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.130
What do you think you're doing, Mom?
You can't hammer nails in a rental.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.800
This isn't even my place.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.940
Oh, no. Did you damage the surface?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.810
You don't think the neighbors heard,
do you?

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.280
Oh, what am I going to do?
Gosh, why would you even...

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.780
- Don't be such a chicken.
- What?

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.290
Let's just eat.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.300
- Oh, by the way.
- Yes?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.940
Can you make me a YouTube account?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.670
YouTube? You're on that stuff now?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.210
I want to play music while I drive.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.780
It's nice and helps me stay awake.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.780
What about a profile picture?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.880
Check my album.
There are plenty of photos in there.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.950
Okay.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.420
What?
Isn't this just a picture of the TV?

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.730
Why are they all pictures like this?

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.790
Seriously? You want to use this
as your profile picture?

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.860
What's wrong with it? It's pretty.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.430
Hey, if you just glance at it,
doesn't it look like I was there?

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.970
Not even a little bit.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.470
Gosh, look at this one.
It's from the home shopping channel.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.010
I'm too busy to go anywhere,
so it's nice to feel like I did.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.180
Too busy? Yes, right.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.410
Mom, get out and get some fresh air.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.020
This fall, go see the fall foliage
or something.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.120
Oh, please.
Only rich people have time for that.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.790
Listen, you have to live
within your means.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.990
There's no point in being greedy
for things you can't have.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.830
Give it here.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.270
Mountains...

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.040
Mountains are nice.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340
Yes.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.770
Gosh, how pretty.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.070
Right?

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.110
A side gig? On a weekend?

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.650
You have to use your downtime
to save up your crypto ammo.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.080
Instead of wasting money on junk,
you should get a side gig, too.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.490
You and Ji Song both.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.420
A side gig? Yes, right.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.060
She's probably passed out cold
right now.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.570
If only you weren't so gorgeous.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.630
I wouldn't have to deal with this.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.700
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.540
Darn it!

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.750
It's her 200-day anniversary
with her boyfriend.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.750
Which means she's crossing borders
as we speak.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.890
Is she on a world tour or something?
I bet pop stars travel less.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.160
Anyway, what's up?
Is something wrong?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.530
You sound a little down.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.260
I'm just feeling
a little unlike myself.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.130
Listen, drinking in a mood like this
is a recipe for disaster.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.870
Don't go getting blackout drunk
and pull the "I don't remember" bit.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.370
- Just go home and call it a night.
- You the designated driver?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.340
Hey, my customer's here.
Talk to you later.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.610
- Hi, did you call for a driver?
- Yes, to Sangdo-dong.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.700
Sir.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.430
Sorry,
I can't drive a car like this.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.670
An accident means the Aoji Coal Mine
and a lifetime of work to repay it.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.410
Come on, it's just...

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.740
I'm sorry.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.010
Look, I'll pay you double!

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.090
Be on your way, Comrade.
And shut the door.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.150
Okay.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.160
You up?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Gosh, what's with this moron?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.630
Darn it.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.270
(Karaoke)

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.040
(Koon Karaoke)

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.510
One beer at a karaoke bar
can't hurt, right?

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.350
Gosh.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.380
I'll never drive foreign cars again.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.190
I was so tense,
my whole body's aching.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.220
Gosh, must be nice.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.120
Some people get to drive supercars,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.730
while others ride a packed bus.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.160
I can't stand it!

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.600
Gosh, I seriously hate my job
so much!

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.200
Then how are you
going to make money?

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.500
Especially since you refuse
to invest in crypto.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.140
Gosh, is crypto your only answer?
I'm so sick of it!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.240
- Fine, go get rich then. Happy?
- Thanks.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.480
So, is there anything you'd do
if you got rich?

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.080
Hey.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.880
When you get rich,
you focus on getting even richer.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.690
The richer you are,
the more you want.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.420
You just think about spending it.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.420
Humor me then. What would you do?

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.330
I don't know. If I were rich,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.690
I'd first toss
nearly-empty toothpaste tubes.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.970
It's so hard to squeeze
an empty tube every morning.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.130
I feel like
I'll burst a blood vessel.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.300
Oh, and I'd stop licking the lids
on yogurt cups.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.570
That's my idea of flexing.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.840
- Oh, hey, you're here.
- Yes, hey.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.910
Oh, hey.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.540
Hey.
What were you guys talking about?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.580
Oh, she was asking what I'd do
if I got rich.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.280
What about you? If you got rich...

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.850
What?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.190
- Does anyone else smell burning?
- What?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.690
If I were rich,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.990
the first thing I'd do
is hammer a nail in my wall.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.030
A nail? Oh, right. You're renting.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.400
Yes, you can't put nails
in the wall.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.630
Seriously? Is that all
you can think of if you got rich?

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.340
- So what would you do?
- Me?

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.300
Well, I...

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.310
I'd be in a penthouse
on the Han River,

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.610
sipping on a 5,000-dollar bottle
of Dom Pérignon.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.550
And then I'd be on the phone
with my dad, like this.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.550
Father, I refuse
a loveless arranged marriage.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.750
You have to let me live my own life!

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.360
And I'd dramatically throw my bag
onto a water buffalo leather sofa,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.520
and say...

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.830
Gosh, life is so utterly empty.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.100
It has gotten a bit warmer, though,
hasn't it?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.330
Yes, you're right.
I guess spring is finally here.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.170
Hey, stop ignoring me.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.440
Around 2 a.m. today, a fire started
at a motel in the Gwanak District.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.040
- Over 20 people...
- Looks like there was a fire.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.380
had smoke inhalation
or injuries as the fire spread.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.610
This is Kim So Young reporting.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.180
A fire broke out at a 9-story motel
in Seoul's Gwanak District at 2 a.m.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.450
Forty guests evacuated the building
when the fire started,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.730
and seven were taken to the hospital
for smoke inhalation.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.860
Suddenly,
the emergency alarms went off.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.060
And smoke was everywhere...
I was so startled,

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.730
I didn't even have time to change.
I just ran out like this.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.700
What? Wait a second.
Aren't those drunk eyes familiar?

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.610
Do they know what caused the fire?

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.540
Hey, isn't that Da Hae?

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.440
Hey! What'd you do while drunk...

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.050
I can't believe this.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.680
What?

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.980
This is you, isn't it, Ms. Round?

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.990
Right?

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.020
No, but how did you...

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.530
What do you mean, "how?"
It's obviously you.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.200
If they're going to blur a face,
they should at least do it better.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.800
What is this? So sloppy.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.200
Here, look at this.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.970
I can totally see your face
right through it.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.640
Look at all these comments.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.970
"The betrayal of the mosaic. LOL."

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.110
"The motel girl's face is
now exposed."

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.250
"I know that feeling
of an office worker..."

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.980
"wanting to set everything on fire."

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.020
You don't want to burn it all down
because of me, do you?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.250
No, of course not. Gosh.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.060
But, Mr. Ko, I'm surprised
you even watch the morning news.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.960
It was on the company message board.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.860
Hoppang Bite posted it.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.900
What? The company message board?

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.570
Gosh, that psycho Hoppang Bite.
I swear I'm going to punch him...

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.700
Don't worry too much.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.210
The admin already took it down.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.540
You can't slander someone like that.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.580
Besides, it barely got any views.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.650
But you know, Da Hae,
you really should get married.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:04.950
What? Why?

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.520
For a single woman...

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.220
to have her face plastered
everywhere like this.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.990
Tell your boyfriend to hurry up
and propose. Okay?

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.020
I actually wasn't with my boyfriend.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.030
Then who?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
Who was it?

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.230
So who was it?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.030
Why'd you just run off
without telling us?

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.740
(Huge Mistake)

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.970
(Huge Mistake)

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.640
Who did you make
this "huge mistake" with?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.210
You're really not going to tell us?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.750
At least give us a hint.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.350
Wait, are you obsessed with
a certain "type" again?

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.290
Type? What type?

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.120
- Rich? Connected? Or just trouble?
- Veins.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.760
Oh, that's right.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.530
You're a total vein freak,
aren't you?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:55.930
I'm not a freak.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.070
Hey, it's not that I just
like any veins.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.570
I like the veins you get
from hard labor.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.110
For example,
like the guys on "Extreme Jobs."

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.450
A man whose bulging veins prove
how hard he's worked.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.850
Isn't that sexy?

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.380
You can see
the unwavering determination...

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.750
not to let his family starve.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.920
Darn. Gosh, that's so hot.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.900
I'm all for sexy, but I'm not sure
about the "unwavering" part.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.270
Hey, you just don't get it.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.710
Because of my dad, for me,
hardworking equals sexy.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.440
If you like hard workers so much,
why are you messing with crypto?

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.380
You should earn your money
the hard way too, then.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.480
Ideals and reality are different,
you know?

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.250
For me, no matter how hard I work,
it's always an extreme struggle.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.120
That's why I took a drastic step
like crypto.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.390
So, was the guy last night
your hardworking, sexy type?

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.290
Was he?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.300
Gosh, you guys.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:03.770
That's...

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.810
My privacy.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.250
Private?
I ought to pry it out of you.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.820
Fine, it was just a
drunken fender-bender.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.450
I'll never see him again.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.890
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.220
With this going on,
you two have unfinished business.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Darn it.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.730
("I didn't even have time
to grab my clothes!")

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.940
(Popular Trending Video)

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.640
"But why was she the only one
they interviewed?"

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.110
"He was probably too embarrassed
to do it. LOL."

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.380
"I mean, her looks are just... LOL."

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.180
"She's decent, I guess."

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.550
Gosh, it didn't even have
that many views in the morning.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.880
This is what you call
the miracle of the algorithm.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.120
I'm going to teach
these trolls a lesson.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.250
- What are you going to do?
- What? You want me to just...

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.320
let them run their mouths?

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.160
I'm going to post a reply.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:08.230
Judging someone's looks or body
is not the mark of a mature person.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.230
- Especially their sex life.
- Hey.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.600
It's an extremely private matter.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.470
So please stop
with the harassing comments.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.710
There.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.340
Oh, a reply!

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.610
"Piss off, geezer."

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680
"Geezer?"
What's that supposed to mean?

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.250
- It's slang for an old person.
- Oh, what a clever little brat.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.290
"Whenever I see people
get triggered like this,"

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.790
"it really melts my frontal lobe."
Why is their frontal lobe melting?

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.820
It means winding you up is so funny
that it melts their brain.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.330
(She's fuming, her BP must be high.)

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.600
"She's fuming, her BP must be high."
And this one?

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.730
They said they really roasted you
with facts, and you've been gutted.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.870
I can't even...

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.670
What? Why did someone just post
a picture of Grandma Na Moon Hee?

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.670
They're saying you're being
frustratingly dense.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.340
Gosh, these trolls...
Wait, how are the replies so fast?

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.110
- Tell them to slow down.
- Stop!

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.550
- Hold on a second. Oh, here.
- The perforated line! Right here!

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.850
Oh, you're right.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.850
What's the perforated line for?

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.350
It means not to post below this.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.650
Basically, a stop.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.150
Wait, what does that even mean?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.420
Forget it. I don't want to know.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.520
Right.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.130
What'd you expect
from the pager era?

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.360
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.060
You?

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.130
You're talking to Kim Ji Song,

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.870
the one rigorously trained
in every kind of SNS to be...

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.200
a professional slacker.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.340
And you're proud of that?

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.140
First,
I'll get the commenter's info.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.170
Let's see what I'm dealing with.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.510
I swear, I was about to
go for the jugular...

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.180
- Then go for it.
- Go for what?

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.150
Get married.
Get married twice! Three times!

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.320
You crazy girl!
Did you already dump Wei Lin?

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.460
Dump him?
What are you talking about?

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.460
My gosh! Talk about a complete 180.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.660
You were just going on and on
about getting married.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.960
But why would I ever dump Wei Lin?

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.530
- Be honest with me.
- About what?

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.630
- Wei Lin...
- What about him?

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.170
- He isn't real, is he?
- What? Wei Lin?

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.100
Mom, don't lie. It's you!

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.040
The username is totally yours.
And I changed your profile picture.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.040
So what if it is?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.750
My daughter is
getting cursed online.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.550
What kind of mother
would just stand by?

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.520
Those jerks.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.090
If someone's daughter goes
to a motel or builds it,

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.420
what business is it of theirs?

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.920
Can you stop with the motel talk?

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.960
Why are you getting so worked up?

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.230
I'll handle my own business.
So just stay out of it.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.660
Okay, fine.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.200
But what about last night?

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.870
I was with my friends.
We just hung out all night.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.010
- So don't get any funny ideas...
- Are you hurt?

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.740
What?

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.740
I asked if you were hurt anywhere,
sweetheart.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.980
- No.
- Okay, good. I'm hanging up.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.190
(Mom)

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.600
No way. Are you kidding me?

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.600
How long has he been standing there?

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.110
Why weren't you answering my calls?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.250
Oh, where did it go? Shoot.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.950
- Gosh, where did it go?
- Did you drop something?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.690
Yes. I dropped something.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.490
I can't seem to find
something of mine.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.430
- Where could it be?
- It must be you common courtesy.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.060
Excuse me?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.840
You know, the common courtesy
of greeting your boss.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.140
I think that's what you dropped.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.640
Oh, right.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.810
Good morning.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.550
Do I look like
I'm having a good one?

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.150
You're all banged up. How?

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.520
So you're a celebrity now. How?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.460
Yes? You want my autograph
or something?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.800
- Are you mocking me?
- On second thought, no autograph.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.030
Only your mom is on your side.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.770
Why were you so mad at her?

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.900
Why were you eavesdropping
on my conversation?

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.040
There's something I'm curious about.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.280
May I ask?

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.340
Gosh.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.950
Dr. Ham.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.090
This is a professional workplace.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.990
Even if you're my superior,
please refrain from this at work.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.530
And interfering in my private life
after hours is...

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.960
- Are you keeping that as a pet?
- Keeping what?

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.010
What is this!

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.210
Oh my gosh! It's on me! Get it off!

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.380
Private life?

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.580
Oh no. Where'd it go?

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.280
- Where is it?
- Okay.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.350
Where did it go?

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.620
Darn it.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.460
So, have you ever caught a big one?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.160
Well... Let's see. Bigeye tuna.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.870
I'm writing to complain about
the motel fire segment this morning.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:16.240
A civilian's face was badly blurred,
violating their privacy.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.210
This is a serious data breach.
Is this for real?

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.310
If these mistakes keep happening,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.020
News Breed will lose credibility.
Thank you.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.420
(Post)

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.390
If this keeps up, I'm unsubscribing.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.690
Facts. Can't argue with that. Right?

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.960
Such a frustrating response.
Fix it ASAP.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.060
(Choose file)

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.300
(Submit, processing)

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.370
(Submission complete)

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.310
(Averages)

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.480
I just posted a complaint
on the news station's message board.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.380
I told them to re-blur the video
and disable the comments.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.510
We can't help who's already seen it,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.280
but we have to do
some damage control.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.720
Eun Sang, I love you.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.490
Ditch that jerk from yesterday.
Why are you taking all the heat?

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.360
Bulging veins mean nothing.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.630
Totally.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.160
There are more than enough
veins in the world.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.570
You're nuts.
Do you know whose veins they are?

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.510
Starting from the first,
it's Seo Kang Jun, Jung Hae In,

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.210
Jung Yong Hwa,
Lee Min Ki, and Byeon Woo Seok.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.740
And for the record, this last one
belongs to my Wei Lin.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.950
(Kim Ji Song)

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.180
(By. Ji Song)

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.820
Then why is your name written
on Wei Lin's arm?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.720
I have to mark my territory,
obviously.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.730
Think of it as an artist
signing their masterpiece.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.030
You're the type
who goes on vacation...

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.730
and scribbles graffiti
all over a national treasure.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.300
(You're mine.)

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.770
What? What's this?

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.140
What memory was that?

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.940
Oh, goodness.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.760
Hello. This is Kim So Young,
a reporter from News Breed.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.830
I'm calling about your message
asking for a follow-up.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.230
So we've taken down all the videos
that were posted online.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.200
We'll contact the person involved
to apologize directly.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.170
Yes, I'd appreciate that.
I'll consider the matter resolved.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.570
I'll hang up now.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.080
- Sorry, are you Ji Sang's mom?
- Who?

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.050
This is reporter Kim So Young.
I used to work on "Press File."

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.790
I covered the daycare bus accident.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.550
I still had your number saved.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.830
His father and I spoke several times
during the follow-up interviews.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.000
Have you been doing okay?

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.940
Oh, yes.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.710
I've been...

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.180
just fine.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.250
My honey's veins are definitely
the hottest.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.020
I said I don't know.
Her face was blurred out.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.720
Oh, come on.
I'm telling you, it's her.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.790
But that wasn't Da Hae...

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.060
Ji Song, what do you mean?

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.470
That news story.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.930
Weren't you talking about
the blurred face?

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.340
Yes, that's right.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.870
About Chae Hee Gyu's latest scandal.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.910
But the actress's face is blurred,
so I can't figure out who it is.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.280
Oh, I thought you meant...

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.180
- That's obviously Min Se Ra.
- What?

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.420
Isn't it Park Se Mi?

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.420
Excuse me? No, it isn't.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.350
What do you mean, no?
The clothes prove it's her.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.090
- What would you know about it?
- Excuse me?

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.600
Wait, are you dissing my knowledge
of celebrity dating and fashion?

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.130
For your information,

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.400
I'm so good I can identify a guy
just by looking at his veins.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.810
What is she even talking about?

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.850
Want to bet ten bucks on it?

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.580
You're on.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.400
All right, everyone, look closely.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.970
If you look at this article,
she's an actress in a recent drama.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.770
For recently-ended dramas,
TV, cable, and web series make six.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.310
Of those, only four of them starred
an actress in her twenties.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.610
That puts a total of four actresses
on our list of suspects.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.980
Let's examine the part of the photo
that isn't blurred,

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.150
the woman's wrist.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.560
That's not a bracelet.
It's a hair tie.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.990
You thought it was
a bracelet, right?

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.220
It's an easy mistake to make.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.260
A limited edition by Bottega Veneta
for this season's product...

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.870
That means our suspect must be
someone who can tie their hair?

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.300
So that narrows it down to two.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.570
And now I see the smoking gun.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.640
Right here. The ring she's wearing.
This one.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.010
It's Roji Jewelry's Opeuroom Ring.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.080
The group Min Se Ra is in are
for ambassadors of Roji Jewelry.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.520
She probably got it for free, right?

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.350
So...

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.860
I'm sure the person in this scandal
is Min Se Ra.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.490
Ji Song, you can actually see that?

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.930
It's my absolute dream item.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.300
I guess since I've looked at
so many photos of it,

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.670
I could spot it from a mile away.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.780
Oh, I guess it really is Min Se Ra.
What?

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.040
Look, an unblurred photo
just popped up.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.580
Oh my gosh.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.780
Gosh, Ji Song, you're amazing.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.520
I mean, how do you know
this so well?

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.950
Oh, it's nothing.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.590
So, ten bucks, right?

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.260
Oh my, that ring.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.630
Isn't that the same one
Min Se Ra was wearing?

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.700
What?

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.760
It is.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.600
Oh my, you're right.
I didn't even notice I had it on.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.640
That must be so expensive.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.040
Of course it is.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.480
- It's not like I can't afford it.
- It's gorgeous.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.350
Ji Song, you're creeping me out.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.220
How can you know so much about it?

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.550
Here.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.730
(Assistant Manager Oh Dong Gyu)

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.000
It's not like she was testing me.
She obviously had the ring herself,

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.540
so why pretend and
make a fool out of me?

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.070
She totally made a fool out of me!

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.910
- It's not even funny.
- Ji Song, calm down.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.410
If it's ridiculous but not funny,

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.180
what does that even mean? What?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.050
Why does she keep messing with me?

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.960
Why is she trying to mess with me?

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.120
- She's feeding you?
- Darn it!

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.730
Someone who feeds you
is a good person.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.660
- Why are you mad?
- No, that's not what I meant!

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.270
Oh? You were here?

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.910
Ji Song, can I give you a hand?

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.980
Hello.
I'm Oh Dong Gyu, Ji Song's coworker.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.380
Do you need an interpreter?

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.490
Oh, hello. You speak Chinese?

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.220
Oh, Assistant Manager Oh,
you speak Chinese?

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.560
And it sounds like
you're really good, too.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.930
I worked at our branch in China
until two years ago,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.800
- so I learned Chinese to manage.
- Oh, right.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.740
But, don't get the wrong idea.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.910
It's not like I can't get over you,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.540
and I'm still trying to
hit on you or anything.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.580
I just really wanted to help
in any way I could.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.020
That's it?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.060
Why was that so short?

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.490
What?

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.130
How could you sum up all my pain
in so few words?

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.800
- Well...
- It's okay, Ji Song.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.300
Stay strong.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.480
And why is he pitying me now?
What was that? What did you say?

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.880
I just said...

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.620
that because you're broke,
your pride is completely shattered.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.650
That was the short version.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.360
I see.
So that's what it all boils down to.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.100
You're right.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:05.830
My pride...

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:07.970
is completely shattered.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.810
This product is getting buzz online,
so it's a shame about its placement.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.550
Oh, you're right.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.150
Can you ask for a spot
on a main aisle?

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.520
It was bumped for another promotion,

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.020
but I'll raise it again next week.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.290
I hear it's a war for shelf space.
It must be tough.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:37.070
But Pepero Sticks are selling well,
so we have some breathing room.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.970
By the way, Da Hee,
are you dating Dr. Ham?

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.640
Excuse me?

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.940
No. Why do you ask all of a sudden?

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.410
An employee at headquarters
saw the two of you together,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.850
and said you looked great together,
so I was just wondering.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.420
No, we're not.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.350
Besides, I've never even been
alone with Dr. Ham.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.960
We're only together in meetings,
and those are always packed.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:04.160
Right?

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.560
Yes, well...

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.600
Oh, then that's what it is.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.270
You're both such knockouts...

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.700
that you're
the only two that stood out.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.470
Like Kang Dong Won and Jun Ji Hyun
outshining us mere mortals.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.170
Oh, no. You're being too kind.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.910
But Da Hee, are you really
not interested at all?

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.350
I think you and Dr. Ham
would be perfect for each other.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.580
I'm not sure about that.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.250
So many people at the company
who have their eyes on Dr. Ham.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.560
Really? Don't tell me...
Da Hae, you too?

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.130
"Don't tell me... Da Hae, you too?"

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:41.300
What was that?
As if to say, "Someone like you?"

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.170
Sorry, but someone like Dr. Ham
isn't really my type.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.110
That's a smart move.
A guy that perfect is just trouble.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.210
Da Hae, are you okay?

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.280
- What? About what?
- About what they said...

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.790
You mean about Dr. Ham?

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:08.790
Oh, please, I'm fine.
I'm not that delusional.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.760
I know we're not a perfect picture.
Why would I be hurt by that?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.670
Birds of a feather flock together.
Like attracts like. It's science.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.500
- I get it. You think I don't know?
- No, I...

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.740
That's not what I meant.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.480
I meant the new product list
you have to finish by tomorrow.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.750
I was asking if you were okay
handling that by yourself.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.550
Oh, right. That.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.190
You know what they say
about protesting too much.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.860
So maybe you do have your eye
on Dr. Ham after all.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.390
Gosh, I said I'm not.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.170
I'm sorry. I was just kidding.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.070
No. It's fine,
you don't have to apologize.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.470
Oh, look, we're at the bus stop.
You should go on ahead.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.910
Okay.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.120
Jung Da Hae, seriously.
What is wrong with you?

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.560
Do we really have to do this?
Is this our only option?

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.330
Look,

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.930
I used to think I wanted to be rich
for a penthouse and Dom Pérignon.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.870
Right. But it's not just that,
is it?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.740
I need to buy a ring, too.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.910
Excuse me?

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.210
I'll get one
that's way prettier and shinier...

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.680
than Assistant Manager Jo's.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.080
And then I'm going to
rub it in her face.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.580
What are you, a magpie?
Why are you always so...

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.550
obsessed with pretty
and shiny things?

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.090
Eun Sang...

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.490
Do I really have to tell you
that story again?

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.560
It's okay, you don't have to.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.130
It goes back to my painful past.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.670
Ever since I was a little girl,
I was always a bit different.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.510
We're going to get some chicken
because it's a hot day.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.040
If we search you and find any money,
you know what happens.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.010
What's this?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.550
Hey.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.850
I knew it!

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.620
Hey, let go of me!

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.520
This ring,

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:25.830
Hyo Ri wore this on TV yesterday!
Oh, my gosh. It's so pretty!

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.300
Where'd you get it?

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.230
How much was it?
Is it real gold? Or plated?

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:32.870
This psycho!

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:39.170
I just always loved pretty things.
I guess I was born with a good eye.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.840
But there was another reason, too.

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.480
Back then, our house was a total...

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.680
dump.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.590
My dad was always away for business,
so my mom was alone and very lonely.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.220
She eventually found something
to pour her heart into,

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.790
but of all things,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.930
it had to be a cult.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.130
Come to think of it, my life's motto
was basically formed then.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.430
I made a vow to myself every day.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.800
That I'd only have beautiful things,
not stinking trash like this,

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.940
but expensive things
that smell good.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.310
Absolutely nothing else.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.380
That's what I'd fill my life with.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.020
Ji Song.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.890
But then...

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.700
- Mom...
- My mom left me...

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.330
- Mom!
- for her cult leader.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400
Mom!

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.270
My dad was
the only family I had left,

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.440
and get this...

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.910
He went and betrayed me too.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.680
Why would you quit your job?

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.010
Why did you donate it all away?

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.550
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.920
We come into the world with nothing,
and die with nothing. That's life.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.390
We even leave this body behind.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.830
Then leave your credit card.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.730
At least leave the house!

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.200
Just stay with me, Dad!

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.170
Don't go!

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.800
Dad!

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.110
Talk about a tragic backstory,
right?

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.190
My childhood was just one big scar.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:35.290
It's a real tearjerker, seriously.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.160
I can manage to listen
without crying.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.600
This is your go-to sob story
whenever you're drunk.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.030
You expect me to cry
every single time?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
You're heartless!

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.170
Another one, please.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.240
That's exactly why you need
to make money.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.210
Maybe making money would help you
heal those wounds, don't you think?

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.420
- What if we did crypto together...
- It's a cult!

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.320
- What?
- As far as I'm concerned,

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.960
crypto is no different than a cult.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.030
You can't see it or touch it.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.400
You don't even know if it's real.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.670
People who get sucked into things
that aren't even tangible...

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.340
are a lost cause, seriously.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.210
Hey.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.910
Then is that 1,250-dollar ring
you saw any less hopeless?

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.750
- Is something so costly worthwhile?
- Oh, that ring.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.050
It was so pretty, though.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.420
I can't take it anymore.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.320
I can't help it.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.890
That little thing
I think it's meant to be mine.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.530
I have to put it on my finger.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.270
Let's go buy the ring.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.170
I'm going to go buy that ring!

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.800
Let's go! Let's go buy the ring.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.140
- Hey!
- Let's go!

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.310
You impossible girl, sit down.
Sit! Just sit down!

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:03.380
Sit down. Sorry about that.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.010
I told you to sit down!

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.450
You guys are out drinking?

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.580
I'll see if I can make it.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.350
Oh, come on!
Just come, even if it's late.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.260
Gosh, this girl.
She's throwing a fit over that ring.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:16.960
I can't handle her alone.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.290
Tell me about it.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.930
- It's better not to get greedy.
- What?

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.570
It's true, though.
When you want what you can't have,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.870
you just end up with a bruised ego,

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.140
and your feelings get hurt, right?

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.610
Wait. Are you talking about Ji Song
or about yourself?

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.750
Is something going on with you?

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.710
What's the number?
Tell me. I'll write it down.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.280
Okay.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.190
What was that?

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:46.750
Okay.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.530
- What is this memory?
- What? What did you say?

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.930
Oh, it's nothing. Never mind.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:57.930
Hold on a second.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.640
You're off the clock, right?
So I can intrude for a moment?

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.510
We need to talk.
Go clean up and meet me in an hour.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.260
It's a masterpiece.
A true work of art.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.800
Something that good deserves
an autograph.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.910
(Claimed! Artistic genius,
National treasure, Smoking hot)

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.280
(Claimed! Artistic genius,
National treasure, Smoking hot)

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.350
He can't wash this off!

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.320
He can't take off the bandage.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.350
- No way.
- What?

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.790
What can't you take off?

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.960
Listen, I've got to go.
I'll call you back.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.090
Stay right there. Don't wash up.
I'm on my way.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.160
Wait! Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.130
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Driver! Stop!

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.470
Sir, wait! Please stop the bus!

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.900
Hey, Da...

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.710
(Kim So Young, News Breed)

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.790
Have you been well, ma'am?

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.220
Been well? Hardly.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.490
How could I possibly be?

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:08.830
Ta-da!

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.400
What do you think? Pretty, right?

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.170
Looks real, doesn't it?

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.670
I might not be doing "well,"

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.380
but life is certainly absurd.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.350
You are something else.
You really have a problem!

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.490
- Hey, you little brat!
- Gosh.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.130
Why would you rip up
the discount coupon?

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.760
It was 20 percent off draft beer.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.530
So much for the discount.
How are we supposed to use it now?

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.980
Please fill out
the Visitor Registration Application Form.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.080
Visitor registration?

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:58.980
(Visitor application)

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:04.120
But I'm just going up for a second.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.390
It won't take long to fill this out.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.420
Okay.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.060
(Ham Ji Woo, Room 3701,
Company colleague)

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:19.770
Here you go.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.440
Please write down your
license plate number.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.810
I took the subway.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.080
Please wait a moment.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.580
Yes. I'm calling
for visitor verification.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.420
You're very kind.
I can just go by myself, you know.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:43.320
The elevator is for residents only.
You need an access card.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:44.790
I see.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.100
I was told it was on the 37th floor.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.100
Get an access card on the 20th floor
and then transfer elevators.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.840
What? I have to make another stop?

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.670
(Visitor application)

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.940
You're missing the
license plate number.

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.040
Subway line nine.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.810
I said I took subway line nine.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.310
Very well.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.070
I felt like I was going
through immigration.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.240
Is this place Fort Knox
or something?

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.840
Gosh.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.440
- I guess it was worth the hassle.
- You really came.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.880
I said we could meet outside,
but you had to come all this way.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.620
Right.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.520
Are you going to shower now?
Want some help?

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.760
How can you say something so forward
right to my face?

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.520
- Let me help you.
- No, I'm okay.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.760
- But it must be uncomfortable.
- I said I'm fine.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.290
- Come on, your arm...
- Ouch! That hurts!

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.000
Thank goodness.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.910
Heavenly Father, thank you.
I'll live a good life from now on.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:09.810
Please watch over me.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.250
- What are you doing?
- What?

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.220
It's nothing.
I guess I was mistaken.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.290
- This?
- It's Sungnyemun.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.290
Excuse me?

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.760
What you were mistaken about.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.760
National Treasure No. 1
is Sungnyemun.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.100
It's not, "Claimed! Artistic genius,
National treasure, Smoking hot."

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.030
Wait, why is that on your arm?
Erase it.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.930
- No, I don't want to.
- I said erase it now!

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.170
No way. I went to great lengths
to preserve this evidence.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.810
What are you, a cop?
Why are you preserving evidence?

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.610
If I didn't keep it,
you'd act like you forgot, right?

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.480
Are you just trying to make me
look like a fool?

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.250
No, it's just...

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.520
Was I the only one who thought
that night was hot?

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.190
What are you talking about?

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.760
That night...

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.660
We were just drunk, that's all.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:03.500
(Last night)

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.340
So?

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.240
If mixed, it could be the title song
for the second album.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.250
Let's just eat the tuna.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.050
Thank you.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:27.990
What kind of reaction is that?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.360
What do you mean?

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.990
You listened to the song.
At least say if it's good or bad.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.030
This is my response.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.630
Stuffing your face with tuna
is your response?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.370
Do you really need
to live your life...

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.610
giving out autographs
to be framed on a wall?

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.680
You're coolest when buying me a meal
and signing the credit card slip.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.410
That's my answer.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.620
Ju Man.
Because you're mainly into metal,

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.060
folk rock just isn't your thing,
right?

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.160
- Are you some kind of masochist?
- What?

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.100
This isn't your first attempt.
You failed spectacularly.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.430
Why so desperate to do music?
Do you enjoy failing or something?

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.840
Does getting hurt give you
some kind of thrill?

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.400
Look...

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.110
There are people who still remember
and love my music.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.180
Hey, with fans like that,
even if I get hurt again,

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.980
don't you think it's worth
giving it another shot?

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.780
Ji Woo,

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:32.090
Okay, repeat after me.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:33.590
What?

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.490
A free cruise? Not interested.
A timeshare? I'll pass.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.660
- What are you saying?
- What does that even...

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.900
So what, you think that person
was trying to sell me something?

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.070
Or maybe they're trying
to save your soul.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.610
- I'm just...
- As your friend,

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.680
I'm only saying this because
I don't want to lose you.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.950
Just keep music as a hobby.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.820
Chef. Can we get another plate
of fatty belly tuna, please?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.130
(Mom)

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.000
Yes, hello?

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.740
Sorry, I was working earlier.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.370
No, I wasn't avoiding your call.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.240
What? A blind date?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.350
What blind date? I'm not going.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.380
I won't meet
a pharma CEO's daughter.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.980
No, I really don't want to.
I mean it, I don't.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.890
Wait, if you're going to cut me off,
why did you even call?

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320
Mom,

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.030
I'm quitting my job at year's end.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.230
I worked there long enough, right?

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.030
I'm...

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.300
I'm going to start
making music again.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.100
I'm going to take this chance
to go all-in on my music.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:00.370
Or so I'd say.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.210
What's the point of saying all that
to a dead line?

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.580
(Karaoke)

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.420
(Koon Karaoke)

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.800
(I'm happy today.)

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.830
(Because you're here,
I'm happy today.)

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.580
(Because you're here,
I'm happy today.)

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.390
(My empty heart is
now full of stars)

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:01.400
Every step I took chasing my dreams

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.370
The voices of everyone around me

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.810
Please shine a little light on me

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.150
Like magic

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:19.050
Make this wish come true

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.760
What a beautiful day

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:28.360
Even the sun and the moon
are on my side

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:30.960
Shining just for me

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.840
- Oh, please love me
- Oh, please love me

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.910
- In my empty heart
- In my empty heart

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.410
- It's full of stars
- It's full of stars

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.180
- Every moment felt like fate
- Every moment felt like fate

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.520
- I wanted to believe
- I wanted to believe

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.990
That someday

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.430
- My day would come
- My day would come

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.330
Be my miracle

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.270
- What a beautiful day
- What a beautiful day

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.710
Even the sun and the moon
are on my side

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.510
Shining just for me

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:23.180
- Oh, come and save me
- Oh, come and save me

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.750
- In my empty heart
- In my empty heart

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.660
- It's full of stars
- It's full of stars

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.080
No way.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:54.210
No way. Someone knows my song.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.520
I mean, how could they know my song?

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.550
Maybe I'll just see who it is.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.920
Yes, I'll just take a look.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.870
Excuse me.
I'm from the room next door.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:16.870
What?

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.010
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.350
I tend to have a bit
of a short fuse.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.990
Well, I wasn't exactly
blameless either.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.860
That was no way to treat a fan.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:37.790
A fan?

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.860
You're my fan, aren't you,
Jung Da Hae?

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.100
Well, it's not so much that
I'm your fan, Dr. Ham.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.240
You see, when I was little,

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.710
I was on this show called
"Echo of Love."

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.850
My family had completely
lost everything.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:00.850
And at the time,

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.350
after the segment about
my family's story aired,

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.790
you sang a song, Dr. Ham.
Do you remember that?

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.330
- That performance?
- It was a total train wreck, right?

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:20.930
It wasn't a train wreck.
I was just extremely nervous.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.270
I went on after TVXQ.
That must've been it.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:29.280
All their fangirls were
so cold to me then.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.610
- I liked it.
- You did? Really?

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:38.520
I was eighteen at the time.

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:42.990
Having to show my face on TV
because my family went broke...

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.490
Honestly,
it was just so humiliating.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.600
Sure, they blurred out my face,

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.060
but still...

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:55.870
I was so worried
someone might recognize me.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.110
I really felt like my life was over.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.810
But that day,

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.480
I felt better
after seeing you, Dr. Ham.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.550
It was like,

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.420
"I guess I'm not the only one
embarrassing myself up here."

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:15.360
"That guy up there must feel
the exact same way."

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.060
Like a sense of camaraderie,
you know?

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.390
Ever since then,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.000
my family went under two more times.

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:27.830
And each time, I'd listen
to your song to get through it.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.870
Like when I was studying
to retake my entrance exams,

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.280
and when I broke up
with my first boyfriend.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680
And...

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.680
the song kind of grew on me.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.350
It's kind of dorky
but heartwarming, you know?

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.100
- If that offended you, I'm sorry...
- I love it.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800
What?

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.740
It's just been so long
since I've gotten a compliment like that.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:06.810
It just makes me so happy.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.520
Goodness.
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.520
- Oh my.
- The fact that my music...

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.220
actually saved someone...

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.860
makes me so incredibly happy.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:27.290
Saved?

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.430
That's a little cheesy...

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.600
I know, but I'm just so
unbelievably happy...

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.840
Even so, I shouldn't make
a mistake like this,

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.110
should I?

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:58.390
You can.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:02.960
It's okay to make that mistake.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.070
By any chance,

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:46.570
if you're trying to sell me
a miracle mattress...

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.210
What?

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.710
Fine, I'll buy one.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.650
For the record, I did nothing wrong
in this whole mess.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.220
The news backs me up.
This injury from saving you...

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.790
You did that interview by yourself
while I was getting it treated.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.590
I rushed over as soon as I was done,
but you just ignored my calls.

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:09.430
- You weren't avoiding me, were you?
- No, of course not...

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.340
Looks like you're about
to hammer in a nail.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.380
What?

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.480
Oh, yes.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.080
A picture frame fell.

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.220
This is what I mean.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.660
- What do you mean?
- You, Dr. Ham,

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:41.360
are a "have" who can put a nail
in your wall whenever you want.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:43.130
But I'm...

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.130
a "have-not" who'd be in big trouble
for putting a nail in my wall.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.470
So, please, just think about it.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.110
If people find out
that a girl like me,

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.110
a girl with no money
and no connections,

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.880
slept with you,
what do you think people will say?

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:59.080
I'd be lucky if they don't call me
a gold digger.

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.250
I doubt they'd say that.

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:02.850
Hey, you never know.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.420
Right.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.790
If I showed any interest, Dr. Ham,
other people would just see it...

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:14.190
as me being greedy. That's it.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:17.130
So...

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.470
let's just call that night
a mistake.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:22.940
It's for the best.

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:45.790
Just so you know,

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.230
if you're ever walking
down the street...

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:52.070
and a scary-looking woman
grabs you by the hair,

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:54.000
just think to yourself,
"So, it's finally happening."

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:55.740
What?

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.870
My mother stopped by earlier.

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:00.670
When I told her I was getting
back into music,

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.810
she demanded to know who's to blame
and then she trashed the place.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.180
Wait, are you...

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.350
Are you saying that's my fault?

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.950
No. I'm saying I envy you.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.350
You have a mom who's always
on your side,

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.220
and the guts to do this
to your boss's arm.

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.290
That's pretty cool.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:20.390
- Hey, about that...
- Jung Da Hae.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.260
You have more than I do.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.060
So...

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.330
don't avoid me.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.650
I keep wanting more.

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:43.080
I want to be rich.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.490
When I'm rich,

00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:48.960
I want to have better, nicer things
than I do now.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.390
And...

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:53.990
I want to feel like I'm worthy
of enjoying all of it.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.430
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:58.100
I want to be greedy
without holding back.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.940
(Enderium)

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.610
(10,000 dollars)

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:14.710
(Buy)

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.520
(Confirm buy order)

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:20.420
(Order placed)

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.890
I don't want to stop anymore.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.300
Let's get started.

00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:39.710
But licking the lid is
just pure instinct.

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:41.570
Okay, you got it?

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.610
Whoever holds out the longest wins.

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:45.140
The loser pays for karaoke.

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.180
Alright, on your marks.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.780
And go!

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.990
Alright.

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.960
Anyway, are you really not going
to tell us?

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:04.260
- Tell you what?
- That huge mistake of yours.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.400
I mean, two consenting adults
hooked up,

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:10.700
so why is that such a big secret?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.840
I know, right?

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:16.210
I came clean about my mom in a cult
and my dad becoming a deadbeat monk.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.580
You should just pick something
to believe in.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.510
There are plenty of things
to worship.

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:25.220
- Queen B, The Rock, or chicken...
- Dr. Ham.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.890
Hey, where did Dr. Ham come from?

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:29.020
Dr. Ham?

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.060
You sleep with Dr. Ham?

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.190
Seriously? For real?

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.560
No way. How could you...

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.230
How did that even happen?

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.530
- Were you drunk?
- Yes.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.510
I almost came to my senses
in the middle of it.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.210
Gosh, but of all things,
it had to be those veins on his arm.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:51.840
So what's going to happen now?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.120
What do you mean?

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.920
I mean, what's the next chapter
for you two?

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.990
Like, is his mom going to show up,
throw an envelope of cash at you,

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:07.630
and splash water in your face
demanding you break up?

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.830
Or is it going to be his first love
who's in Paris right now...

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.470
about to make a grand return
to Korea?

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.770
A 5 feet 6 inches, 48kg girl
with long, straight hair...

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:22.240
Is Dr. Ham's first love
going to show up?

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.610
Hey, is this first love supposed
to be Jun Ji Hyun or something?

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:29.250
- She's so wrecked.
- No, I'm not.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:32.990
I'll have a little chat with this
Jun Ji Hyun and we'll sort it out.

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:36.820
What's with this go-getter attitude?

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.030
You're not even talking about
giving up.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.030
- Is it love?
- Oh, you're in love?

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:44.900
It's not like that.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:48.230
I...

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.040
- I put ten grand into crypto.
- What?

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.100
What?

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.740
I maxed out my line of credit.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.410
I'm going all in.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.410
Once I'm rich,

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.450
I'll hammer nails in my own walls...

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.450
and take my mom to Mount Geumgang.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.720
I'll go as far as my money takes me
without ever stopping.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:09.220
And if I do all that,

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.690
then even someone like Dr. Ham
won't be out of my reach.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.730
You never know.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.100
You know, no wonder.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.700
You just seemed larger
than life today.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.670
It's because you made
this huge decision.

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.470
Aren't you just bloated?
Looks like you gained some weight.

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:30.710
Ji Song, want to take
a walk with me?

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:33.280
That streetlight seems
like a good spot for a beating.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.320
I'm going to a karaoke bar.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.550
Busted! Yes, karaoke!

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.790
Darn it.

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.420
Hey, Eun Sang is licking hers too.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.960
Oh, she's been doing that for ages.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.400
Oh, right.
Yes, you licked yours earlier.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.170
What?

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.400
When did I lick this?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.140
You've still got a long way to go.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.870
We're too cheap to win the jackpot.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.970
No way.

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.540
I'm telling you, we're not ready.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.140
Look at this!

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.050
What?

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.210
(Congratulations!
You've won a free one.)

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:09.320
- Jackpot.
- Jackpot.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.630
No way! I can't believe this!

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.570
Bringing a breath of fresh air
to the 2004 music scene.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.910
Please welcome amateur singer
Ham Ji Woo.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.080
(Echo of Love)

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.880
(Epilogue)

01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:44.150
("Shooting Star" by Ham Ji Woo)

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.050
(18 years old with many dreams)

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:50.590
In a corner of the dawn sky

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:56.500
Another star appears
in the weeping woods

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.440
In the blink of an eye,
right above my head

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.170
Pouring down like rain

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.780
A beautiful day

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:17.450
Even the sun and the moon
are on my side

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:20.150
Shining just for me

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.860
Oh, please love me

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.230
In my empty heart

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.900
It's full of stars

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:40.110
(Da Hae breathes
another heavy sigh today.)

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:50.820
That was the rookie singer
Ham Ji Woo's...

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.090
performance.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.850
Yes, well...

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.190
for our plucky girl...

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.260
- chasing her dreams,
- Yes.

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:04.900
- Please support Da Hae and family.
- That's right.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.610
Hey, guys! You're here?

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.480
- You saw "Echo of Love" yesterday?
- Of course!

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.940
- You did?
- It was wild.

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.410
But wasn't it super lame?

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.280
A little? Yes, it totally was.

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:24.520
- Totally cringey!
- What? Cringey?

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.290
Like,
"tears welling up in my eyes" bad.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.790
How can he show his face after that?

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.560
Wasn't that voice crack insane?

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.090
- Tell me about it.
- I feel so bad for them.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.460
- I know.
- I'd be too embarrassed to show it.

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:38.430
- I can't even watch it.
- Gosh, seriously.

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:39.600
What are they going to do?

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.600
- What's first period today?
- Oh, Math.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.370
Did you do the homework?

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.440
- Of course not.
- Nope.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.010
(Cheongan Girls' High School)

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.880
(To the Moon)

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040
Are you quitting?

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:26.010
I don't expect anything from those
who didn't even add me to the chat.

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.680
I'll add you, Ji Song.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.380
She's walking on eggshells.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.920
She knows she's an outcast.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.950
Our team?

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:33.850
Why are you so serious
about company dinners?

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.960
So what should I do if I want
to have a fling with someone?

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:37.460
Don't you have your eye on Dr. Ham?

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.490
I heard there was a party tomorrow.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.930
It's the perfect day
for a total transformation.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.500
Dr. Ham will also be at Table One.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.870
Who should be the star
of this very seat?

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:49.100
I'm going to sit next to Dr. Ham
at tomorrow's event.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.170
Promise me you'll sit next to me.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.440
What are you doing?
Why did you remove my name?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.710
