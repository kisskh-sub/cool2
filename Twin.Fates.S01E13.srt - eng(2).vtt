(The Last Golden Feather)

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.177
At last, I've found you.

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:25.937
It's the Silver Fox Clan.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:34.857
White-clad Immortal...

00:01:38.537 --> 00:01:39.577
Who exactly are you?

00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:41.377
Who am I?

00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:45.897
I'm the one
who's going to seize your Xuanzhu Jade.

00:01:56.937 --> 00:01:57.777
Mu Lingxue...

00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:01.857
It turns out

00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:03.497
that you're Bai Li.

00:02:03.817 --> 00:02:05.417
So what
if you've figured out my identity?

00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:07.617
You're dying after all.

00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:08.977
Speak.

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:11.177
Where is the Xuanzhu Jade?

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:13.417
I won't hand it over to you
even if it costs my life!

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:31.017
The Xuanzhu Jade
is actually in your body.

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:37.177
Sneeze.

00:02:38.017 --> 00:02:38.697
Sneeze.

00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:44.977
Sneeze!

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.350
Bai Li.

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.125
You're as soft-hearted as ever.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.385
But your kindness

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.305
seems just like a joke.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.782
Who do you think you can save
with your sympathy?

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:18.397
Yanlie's death

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.335
and the ice-sealing of our clan

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:22.497
are all your doings.

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.825
It tells how incompetent you are.

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:57.817
How come you remain powerful?

00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:25.057
Hang in there,

00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:27.017
Mu Lingxue.

00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:40.017
(I need to get myself another body.)

00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:10.417
This is such a nice body.

00:05:23.897 --> 00:05:24.737
That woman

00:05:24.937 --> 00:05:26.137
cherished this jade pendant,

00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:27.110
and she always had it with her.

00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:30.337
I think you will

00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:32.925
find it handy eventually.

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:36.937
(It's actually come into use.)

00:05:53.137 --> 00:05:54.720
(This is a strong poison
from the Silver Fox Clan.)

00:05:55.817 --> 00:05:57.377
(If this goes on,
she will lose her life in no time.)

00:05:59.112 --> 00:05:59.792
(No way.)

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.360
You cannot die.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.520
(What do I do?)

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.415
(What should I do?)

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.600
(My golden feather...)

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.000
(Yes, I can use my golden feather.)

00:07:18.377 --> 00:07:19.617

Chi Yu, what are you doing?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.800
Your shoes are wet.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.040
Remove them and air dry them.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.680
What is this?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.120
I'm gifting them
to some rural woman in the outskirt.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.000
You sure are generous.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.280
What should I wear, then?

Bai Li would come after you again.

That was just a body of hers.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.160

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.760
