(The Emperor's Nightmare)

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.440
Chi Yu.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.520
Take the concoction first.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.100
It's hot. Let me blow on it for you.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.240
Are you alright?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.480
You're even feeding me the concoction.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.600
I'm all fine.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.680
Since the gas

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.840
was removed from my body,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.320
I've felt much better.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.640
Here, eat the concoction.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.360
Go ahead.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.760
His Majesty has arrived.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.000
Qingci.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.160
I've brought you a treasure.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.960
What's happened to you?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.640
I've accidentally caught a cold.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.760
Leave it to me.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.320
Just the right temperature.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120
Your Majesty, are you alright?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.360
I'm good.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.040
It was the wind.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.320
Yuchen,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.520
I'm a bit sleepy.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.120
Fine.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.560
Get some rest now.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.080
Sure.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.120
Let me see you out, Yuchen.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.480
Forget about it.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.400
Take some good rest.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.520
Just the right temperature?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.920
It's gone cold.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.200
Master.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.720
What is it with you?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.280
It's nothing.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.200
I thought of manipulating Chi Yu's body

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.800
with the Soul-Pulling Spell.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.440
Unexpectedly, it backfired.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.720
But it's alright.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.640
I've found myself

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.280
a more suitable subject.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.000
Yuchen.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.520
You like Ji Qingci, right?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.480
That's right.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.760
However,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.840
she's your sister.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.040
So you will never be together.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.760
No...

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.120
No...

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.040
No...

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.640
No...

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.120
What if

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.840
she weren't your sister?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.400
Indeed.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.160
You're my sister.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.680
She belongs to me.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.600
My beloved consort.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:04.062
(Ji Qingci)

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.320
Greetings, Yuchen.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.120
I wonder what you're here for.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.280
Let me ask you a question.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.280
Who exactly are you?

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.520
Naturally, I am Ji Qingci.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.600
Then who is she?

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.160
She is my sister

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.040
and Lord Yi's legitimate daughter,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.120
Ji Qingci.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.640
I'm not.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.640
I'm not.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.960
Pardon me.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.880
This girl

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.360
is an orphan

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.800
whom I saved days ago.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.400
Is that so?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.680
But I heard

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720
that she had
Lord Yi's jade pendant with her

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.920
when you were saving her.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.600
This jade pendant

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.720
is a gift from Qingci.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.000
Yet I remember

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.880
you only had half of the jade pendant

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.200
upon your return.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.520
After what I've been through,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.520
the other half of it was lost.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.120
Now she has it with her.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.240
That means it's all fated.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.680
No...

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.200
No!

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.600
Qingci.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.120
This is too much of a coincidence.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.880
The other half of the jade pendant

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.680
and the same scar

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.240
have been found

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.320
on this orphan of unknown origin.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.600
Who among you

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.880
is lying to me?

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.480
All I need is your answer.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.880
Tell me.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.440
Are you truly Ji Qingci?

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.760
Say yes

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.640
and I shall get rid of her for you.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.480
That will put your mind at ease.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.920
I'm not Ji Qingci.
