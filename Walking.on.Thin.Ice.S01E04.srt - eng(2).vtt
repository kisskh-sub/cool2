WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:44.000
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:45.482
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.320
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:50.269
Hey, didn't you tell me

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:52.726
the maturity rate was 3.5%?

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:55.245
How come it's only 3% now?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.999
Sir, as I explained before,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.309
if you deposit at least
500,000 won for 6 months,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.163
you get a preferential rate of 0.5%.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.017
But on your 4th payment,
you only deposited 200,000 won.

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:08.309
You never said that!

00:01:09.088 --> 00:01:14.549
You scammers!
Shut up and give me my money!

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.276
Sir, calm down.

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:20.763
Argh, Damn it...

00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:24.498
Sir.

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:29.601
- Then how about this product?
- What?

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:32.392
It’s a savings plan
with a base rate of 2.5%.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:35.884
If you use our credit card,
you get an extra 3%.

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:39.876
That’s a total of 5.5%.

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:44.395
Are you trying to fool me again?

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:48.309
Normally, credit card holders
must spend 10 million won a year.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.434
But since you're new,

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:54.392
you only need to spend 5 million
to get the same benefit.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.849
I don't give a damn.
Screw it!

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.309
You're already spending
more than that with your debit card.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.848
If you use that same amount
with a credit card,

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.809
you'll get higher interest benefits.

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.601
Wait, what...?

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:14.601
And you're turning 65 this month.

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:16.642
- You will be tax-exempt.
- Huh?

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:21.617
High interest rate plus tax exemption.
Wouldn't that be perfect?

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.517
Uh, well...

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.559
Happy early birthday, sir.

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:31.401
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:32.878
No, thank you.

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.221
Have a good day.

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:44.295
You're amazing.

00:02:44.327 --> 00:02:48.545
You even signed him up
for a credit card? Incredible.

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:51.981
You've never raised your voice,
have you?

00:02:56.434 --> 00:02:59.267
Hey, you bastards!
Stop right there!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.100
Give me my money!

00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:03.142
Bastards!

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.309
I said, give me my money!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.059
EPISODE 4

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.071
- Tell me your name!
- What?

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.005
Shut the fuck up!

00:03:22.684 --> 00:03:25.849
How dare the police bully
an innocent citizen!

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:32.403
What are you here for?

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:35.267
Can't you hear me?

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.849
Detective, do something
about this man!

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.849
ART CLASS TUTOR

00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:58.184
You fucking bitch!

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:04.726
ART CLASS TUTOR

00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:07.543
Where are you?

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.060
You didn't really go
to the police, right?

00:04:12.283 --> 00:04:13.990
Come out, now.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.184
I'll do as you say,
so get out of there!

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.295
Come out, right away.

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:27.423
Hey, Miss. Follow him.

00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:29.559
What's with the smirk?

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:30.601
Next.

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.350
If you look here...

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.849
- Huh?
- What?

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.849
There was a woman sitting there.

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.226
What are you saying?

00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:43.392
Hey, you over there!
Come sit. Good.

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:45.142
Take care of her first.

00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:50.800
You are fucking crazy.

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.918
You won't go down alone, huh?

00:05:57.592 --> 00:05:58.722
So what now?

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.723
Speak up, woman!
How are you going to fix this?

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:07.036
Watch your tone, little brat.

00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.430
What?

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.601
Did you think you could
talk down to me

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.806
just cuz I was polite?

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:23.644
Am I crazy? Yes, absolutely.

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.317
Don't you have any sympathy?

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:29.582
If you take all the drugs,
what will happen to my family?

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.862
Die on the streets?
Are you insane?

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.768
Why should I cut you slack?
Am I your son?

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:46.726
I even cut ties with my own family.
Why should I care about you?

00:06:47.412 --> 00:06:49.601
Your pathetic family situation?

00:06:50.074 --> 00:06:51.685
They're very common on the streets.

00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:54.699
You're a bastard.

00:06:55.173 --> 00:06:56.965
Did you expect
a drug dealer to be nice?

00:07:08.814 --> 00:07:10.094
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.448
Anyway, you can't sell at Medusa.

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.848
There are other places to operate.

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:20.085
Gwangnam is full of clubs.

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:25.374
Where are you, James?

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:28.726
I'm going to kill you.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.043
200 million.

00:08:07.642 --> 00:08:10.517
Between my husband's medical bills
and the house mortgage,

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:12.350
186.7 million won.

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:14.859
That's all I need to get.

00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:18.559
When I make 200 million,
I'm quitting.

00:08:19.407 --> 00:08:21.148
I'll give you the rest of the drugs.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:26.642
How about that?
Still not interested?

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.225
Really?
You'll give me the rest?

00:08:51.768 --> 00:08:54.601
The signal cut off here, right?

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:09.975
I don't trust you.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:11.849
Did you say at least 8 billion?

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:14.452
Prove it then.

00:09:15.426 --> 00:09:16.426
100 million in two weeks.

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.848
Make it happen,
and we'll talk again.

00:09:19.132 --> 00:09:21.198
I need to verify your capability.

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:24.848
If you do anything funny
behind my back again,

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:28.354
I'll show our contract video to Sua.

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:34.061
Like you said, we'll die together.
Let's see who ends up worse.

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:40.850
Fine by me.

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:48.975
Okay, it's a deal.

00:10:13.434 --> 00:10:15.933
What have I gotten myself into?

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:17.849
PURCHASE LIST

00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:24.872
There are various methods.
Snorting, dissolving in water...

00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:26.225
Freebasing is common too.

00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:29.234
Injection hits the vein directly,
so it's the strongest.

00:10:29.937 --> 00:10:31.055
But I don't recommend it.

00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:33.617
Why not?

00:10:35.249 --> 00:10:39.849
Because they get addicted faster.
They lose their mind.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.326
It leaves a mark on the arm,
their speech slurs,

00:10:44.404 --> 00:10:47.451
and then everyone notices.
"He's on drugs."

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:50.517
Someone calls the cops,
they get arrested, and if unlucky,

00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:52.813
we get traced too.

00:10:53.845 --> 00:10:56.994
- Excuse me, do you have this in stock?
- I'll check.

00:10:57.064 --> 00:11:00.955
Just because someone wants to buy
doesn't mean they're all good.

00:11:00.978 --> 00:11:05.476
Our goal is to build a long-term
and safe customer base.

00:11:05.517 --> 00:11:08.309
You need to analyze
in just a few lines of chat

00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:11.388
whether they're thoughtless zombies
or potential customers.

00:11:12.684 --> 00:11:13.849
Okay?

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:16.180
Okay.

00:11:17.204 --> 00:11:20.849
- Sir, here you go.
- Thank you.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.100
Prices change like stocks.
Every day is different.

00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:38.594
Anywhere from 500k
to 800k won per gram.

00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:40.392
The seller dictates the price.

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:43.848
There are discounts for bulk purchases.
Dealers compete.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:47.848
Last time I bought,
it was 15 million for 100 grams.

00:11:47.849 --> 00:11:50.287
So it's more profitable
to sell in small amounts?

00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:53.936
On paper, yes.
But the risk is higher.

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:58.434
More transactions mean
more chances of getting caught.

00:11:58.603 --> 00:12:03.726
It may be more advantageous
to sell in bulk for a lower price.

00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:08.100
If sold at 500k won per gram, 20
transactions a day, that's 70 mil a week.

00:12:08.142 --> 00:12:12.309
In two weeks, it'll be 140 mil.
My cut will be 42 mil.

00:12:12.505 --> 00:12:14.559
Net gain, not even 100 mil.

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:20.580
If sold at 800k per gram,
you'd take around 330 mil,

00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:23.005
and I'd get 140 mil a month.

00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:25.850
In six weeks, I'd make 200 mil.

00:12:26.758 --> 00:12:28.849
Are you a human calculator?

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:34.380
Keep a separate phone
for business only.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:37.977
Never use Kakao, Instagram,
or Facebook for sales.

00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:40.684
One slip and your info's out.

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:43.078
Only use apps that leave no trace.

00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:47.350
If we link accounts,
you can use my ID too. Got it?

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:51.267
Leave no record, link accounts.

00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.331
- What are you doing?
- Taking notes.

00:12:53.997 --> 00:12:55.415
Yeah? Let me see.

00:13:03.714 --> 00:13:06.130
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Look who's talking.

00:13:06.374 --> 00:13:09.350
I told you not to leave records,
and you're writing it down?

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:12.478
Don't you dare
write down anything I say.

00:13:12.726 --> 00:13:13.933
Unbelievable.

00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:17.776
- You know what perspective is, right?
- Yes.

00:13:17.784 --> 00:13:20.726
It's the sense of distance,
near and far.

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:23.103
What you need then
is a vanishing point.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.821
If everything meets at one point,
it's a 1-point perspective...

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:36.798
We always guarantee
the highest quality and trust.

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:39.975
Secure. High quality.

00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:43.849
Top purity.
Inquiries open 24/7.

00:13:44.017 --> 00:13:47.100
ICE, CRYSTAL, SAFEDEAL

00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:50.809
- How was your date?
- He looked nothing like his profile.

00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:52.426
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:13:55.412 --> 00:13:56.454
A new arrival!

00:13:58.017 --> 00:13:59.267
THANK_U

00:13:59.402 --> 00:14:02.074
- Oh, we got a message.
- You got some?

00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:04.975
He means drugs.

00:14:05.254 --> 00:14:08.309
Did you expect to exchange greetings?

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.515
Yeah.

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:14.225
How much for a stick?

00:14:14.343 --> 00:14:17.218
- A stick?
- He's referring to a syringe.

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:21.050
It's like a sales unit.
A syringe takes up one gram.

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:26.517
- How do you deliver?
- Courier. Where to?

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.975
Gyeonggi-do.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:32.362
Keep your answers short.
Always verify before selling.

00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:33.848
- Verification.
- Verification?

00:14:33.849 --> 00:14:35.892
An ID or proof of actual use.

00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:39.267
Something to prove that
he's not a cop or a threat.

00:14:41.346 --> 00:14:42.309
Address.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.995
Verification's done
for safety reasons.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540
Safety from what?

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:49.998
No guarantee that
they won't backstab me like you.

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:51.267
They might also resell.

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:53.350
If they leak us to the cops,

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.849
we have something
to use against them.

00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:58.476
Like how you threatened me?

00:15:12.267 --> 00:15:13.267
Counseling.

00:15:19.828 --> 00:15:21.809
Unless we want
the whole world to know,

00:15:21.849 --> 00:15:24.949
let's fix our meeting spot,
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo.

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.726
Oh, come on!

00:15:33.878 --> 00:15:35.726
Aren't you going overboard?

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.818
Going this hard?
Against a yellow belt?

00:15:59.014 --> 00:16:01.017
You're gonna kill me.

00:16:03.123 --> 00:16:05.309
You should work out often.

00:16:06.907 --> 00:16:08.260
It's not my thing!

00:16:10.104 --> 00:16:12.329
Sir, we need to head out.

00:16:13.058 --> 00:16:14.204
Bro...

00:16:15.363 --> 00:16:17.470
Kyungdo, put on your uniform.

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:19.809
I said put it on, punk!

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.750
Judging from his height,
he looks like James.

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.750
Can we rewind a bit?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.314
Who's that?

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.740
There were a lot of people.
I don't remember them all.

00:17:15.553 --> 00:17:16.857
Never seen either of them.

00:17:17.492 --> 00:17:20.070
Maybe a urine test
will jog your memory.

00:17:24.114 --> 00:17:25.251
Got a warrant?

00:17:30.337 --> 00:17:31.262
You're funny.

00:17:55.738 --> 00:17:57.847
Argh, damn it.

00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:03.933
Look, that woman disappeared
at the transfer station.

00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:07.288
She kept changing clothes
and switching trains.

00:18:08.764 --> 00:18:11.660
She's a total pro.

00:18:35.512 --> 00:18:36.933
I won't harm you.

00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:39.215
You probably have a taser gun anyway.

00:18:39.692 --> 00:18:42.309
Hurry up.
You need to try it yourself.

00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:01.267
I'LL TAKE THREE.

00:19:01.498 --> 00:19:02.848
I'll take three.

00:19:02.849 --> 00:19:06.412
Verification, please.

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:09.849
- You first.
- You first?

00:19:12.674 --> 00:19:14.744
He wants me to verify.
Should I?

00:19:14.923 --> 00:19:17.872
Send him a photo of your ID.

00:19:20.295 --> 00:19:21.133
Really?

00:19:22.055 --> 00:19:25.642
Of course not!
Haven't you learned anything?

00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:30.476
You're a scammer!

00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:36.133
What's this?
It's all gone.

00:19:36.163 --> 00:19:39.385
He thought you were a scam
and ditched the chat.

00:19:39.441 --> 00:19:43.308
Why are you overthinking your replies?
This isn't insurance sales.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:45.800
Don't think of explaining.
Just get to the point.

00:19:46.277 --> 00:19:50.517
People will suspect you
if you're polite or talkative.

00:19:53.037 --> 00:19:55.517
When will you ever make a 100 million?

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.013
What about packaging?
You're not going to send it raw, right?

00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:03.933
Of course not.
I've thought of something.

00:20:20.368 --> 00:20:22.017
Mom, I'm home.

00:20:22.434 --> 00:20:23.768
Hey!

00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:29.918
- What are you doing?
- I dropped my phone under there.

00:20:29.926 --> 00:20:32.848
- Want me to help?
- No, it's fine. I got it.

00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:33.849
You can leave.

00:21:15.924 --> 00:21:20.709
Doing it together
makes it faster, right?

00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:22.748
Don't talk to me.

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:41.848
DROP-OFF DELIVERY

00:21:41.849 --> 00:21:42.849
DOMESTIC SHIPPING

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.267
Place the parcel on the scale.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.982
Place your package on the scale
and press the service button.

00:22:04.517 --> 00:22:06.809
- Are you Park J.H.?
- Mr. Yoo Minki?

00:22:06.849 --> 00:22:07.849
Here you go.

00:22:22.544 --> 00:22:23.896
What happened to you?

00:22:23.943 --> 00:22:25.044
You seem different today.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.184
I switched to this recently.
It's crazy good.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:34.225
Let's do another round
after taking this.

00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:36.848
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:39.403
- Paying by card?
- Yes. Card, please.

00:22:45.356 --> 00:22:46.699
Hey, Donghyun!

00:22:46.802 --> 00:22:49.812
You're looking sharp.
Good luck today!

00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:00.597
HWANG DONGHYUN

00:23:05.433 --> 00:23:07.222
James ghosted himself.

00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:11.689
Then find one of his old partners.

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:17.306
Next up, No.34 Lee Jina
and No.35 Hwang Donghyun.

00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:24.747
Good afternoon.

00:23:27.642 --> 00:23:29.981
Ms. Lee Jina,
please introduce yourself first.

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:33.850
Hello, I'm applicant number 34,
Lee Jina.

00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:38.309
Hello, I'm applicant number 35,
Hwang Donghyun.

00:23:49.749 --> 00:23:50.848
COP

00:23:50.849 --> 00:23:54.638
I already told everything.
Why do they keep calling?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.813
Excuse me.
You shouldn't spit on the floor.

00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:06.434
What?

00:24:15.849 --> 00:24:17.142
Let go!

00:24:17.184 --> 00:24:19.684
Hey, let go of me!

00:24:41.817 --> 00:24:44.045
Please, don't kill me.
I'm begging you.

00:24:50.184 --> 00:24:51.848
I really don't know.

00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:54.309
Not just me, nobody knows.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.486
No one knows his name,
number, or where he lives.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.559
Oh, but you have to.
You can't leave otherwise.

00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:04.184
I've got money.
I can pay you.

00:25:09.371 --> 00:25:10.621
Stay still.

00:25:21.267 --> 00:25:22.267
KANG HWIRIM

00:25:27.329 --> 00:25:29.984
- Hello?
- Bro! It's me, Minwoo.

00:25:31.999 --> 00:25:33.850
I've got something to ask.

00:25:35.142 --> 00:25:38.059
- Do you have James's number?
- Huh? Who?

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:41.601
Wrong number.
Don't call me again.

00:25:41.642 --> 00:25:45.268
Bro, wait.
Don't play with me now...

00:25:47.517 --> 00:25:50.000
Wait, I'll try calling someone else.

00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:52.933
I swear, no one really knows.

00:25:52.975 --> 00:25:56.434
Please, stop.
Give me one more call.

00:25:56.476 --> 00:25:59.684
Hold up, what's that?
What are you doing?

00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:01.392
- Don't!
- Grab him.

00:26:01.434 --> 00:26:02.517
Okay.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:05.424
Don't do it!
What is that?

00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:09.848
They're selling it!
It's being sold, okay?

00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:13.060
I saw someone
selling your drugs online.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.404
I swear, it's true!

00:26:14.787 --> 00:26:15.726
Let him go.

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:18.100
Don't kill me.

00:26:19.184 --> 00:26:20.849
I'm begging you.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:49.969
We can't do cash deals like before.

00:26:50.262 --> 00:26:51.595
Bank transfers are risky too.

00:26:52.008 --> 00:26:56.144
Any deposit over ten million won
gets flagged automatically.

00:26:57.222 --> 00:26:58.605
So we need ghost accounts?

00:26:59.003 --> 00:27:00.082
Maybe six or so.

00:27:00.105 --> 00:27:03.144
You can take out
only so much using ATMs.

00:27:03.214 --> 00:27:05.848
And these days,
opening accounts is near impossible...

00:27:05.849 --> 00:27:06.632
Screw that.

00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:12.005
Don't worry about payments.

00:27:12.849 --> 00:27:16.632
Money management is my job.

00:27:32.128 --> 00:27:35.561
All trades must be done
using Bitcoin. Untraceable.

00:27:38.642 --> 00:27:41.225
LOGIN

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:50.392
OTP VERIFICATION

00:27:50.434 --> 00:27:51.452
WITHDRAWAL REQUEST COMPLETED

00:27:51.476 --> 00:27:55.849
Then we cash out in small amounts
through multiple exchanges.

00:28:20.727 --> 00:28:23.849
We launder our money
and even earn bonuses.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.517
Finally, we withdraw from a ghost account.

00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:38.059
Please take your card and receipt.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.184
Thank you for using our service.

00:28:42.142 --> 00:28:43.582
Processing your transaction request.

00:28:48.706 --> 00:28:50.849
Counting cash.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.434
Please take your card and receipt.

00:29:23.768 --> 00:29:25.642
5.4 mil.

00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:28.975
Wow.

00:29:34.362 --> 00:29:38.119
Do you know how much
I used to make at Medusa a day?

00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:41.057
Yet, for a whole week...

00:29:42.849 --> 00:29:45.787
Just 5.4 mil?

00:29:46.756 --> 00:29:49.892
When will we ever reach 8 billion?

00:29:50.174 --> 00:29:52.090
Remember the test I gave you?

00:29:53.912 --> 00:29:55.611
You have less than a week left.

00:30:28.289 --> 00:30:29.642
Units of sale?

00:30:30.427 --> 00:30:31.849
1g, 3g, 5g.

00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:35.161
Do you sell bigger?
Like 300g.

00:30:36.449 --> 00:30:37.490
300g...

00:30:40.392 --> 00:30:44.142
Yes. The price is...

00:30:46.363 --> 00:30:47.613
80 mil.

00:30:50.124 --> 00:30:51.225
60 mil.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:56.496
Final price, 70 mil.
Or find someone else.

00:30:57.849 --> 00:31:00.059
SAERO GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL
PARENTS' CHATROOM

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:18.926
How about 65 mil...

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.231
Mom, you have a message.

00:31:20.933 --> 00:31:23.142
Oh, I was sleeping.

00:31:23.442 --> 00:31:24.476
Give it to me.

00:31:25.896 --> 00:31:27.896
- I think it's a group chat.
- Thanks.

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:41.809
Deal.

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:10.434
Delivery, okay?

00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:15.849
No. Must see first. Cash.

00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:19.850
That won't work.

00:32:20.092 --> 00:32:21.809
Then no deal.

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:26.768
You have less than a week left.

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:28.768
Gosh, what do I do?

00:32:38.849 --> 00:32:42.578
Eleven, twelve... twelve?
Is everyone here?

00:32:42.672 --> 00:32:45.267
- No, one's missing.
- Who?

00:32:46.694 --> 00:32:47.985
Eunsoo.

00:32:49.003 --> 00:32:51.392
This is unacceptable.

00:32:51.849 --> 00:32:54.684
How many times
has she skipped already?

00:32:54.904 --> 00:32:57.022
She doesn't even check
the group chat.

00:32:57.022 --> 00:32:59.849
You know she's got her reasons.

00:33:00.398 --> 00:33:01.584
Right?

00:33:03.038 --> 00:33:06.601
Eunsoo has the most caring family.

00:33:06.642 --> 00:33:10.059
With her husband sick now,
we should understand.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.100
Can't be helped.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.269
Right, Professor Yang?

00:33:19.345 --> 00:33:21.012
I won't be home.
Business trip.

00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:25.153
What's so special about
a caring family?

00:33:32.768 --> 00:33:35.059
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:10.849
Dojin.

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:14.450
Jinhee?

00:34:22.138 --> 00:34:23.426
Enjoying the TV?

00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:27.105
You really didn't have to.

00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:30.820
Relax, we're not strangers.

00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:32.892
Besides, it's nothing much.

00:34:33.057 --> 00:34:34.973
Plus Eunsoo's been busy.

00:34:36.766 --> 00:34:40.797
It's what friends are for.
To help out here and there.

00:34:43.472 --> 00:34:47.097
You and Eunsoo are
having it hard because of me.

00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:53.369
Don't say that.
It's not your fault for being sick.

00:34:54.697 --> 00:34:56.838
Plus, husbands like you are rare.

00:34:56.849 --> 00:35:01.080
Someone like Eunsoo is rarer.
I'm a lucky man.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.059
Stop acting like newlyweds.
So gross.

00:35:07.768 --> 00:35:09.309
When is Eunsoo coming?

00:35:17.446 --> 00:35:18.845
Short stay or full night?

00:35:23.513 --> 00:35:25.472
I want your spot for an hour.

00:35:25.618 --> 00:35:26.895
Just one hour, right?

00:35:38.392 --> 00:35:39.531
Short stay.

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:11.100
Room 203.

00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:14.925
I made a reservation.

00:37:10.422 --> 00:37:11.635
It's too little, okay?

00:37:12.421 --> 00:37:14.116
We're running low on ammo.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.768
How many shares of TwoN Group
have we bought?

00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:19.198
A little less than 100,000 shares.

00:37:19.392 --> 00:37:22.995
It's 50,000 won per share.
This money won't get us even 1000.

00:37:24.346 --> 00:37:26.434
Wasn't your goal
at least 150,000 shares?

00:37:26.849 --> 00:37:28.975
You told Austin
as if you had them already.

00:37:29.053 --> 00:37:32.256
That was the only way
to get him interested in TwoN.

00:37:33.006 --> 00:37:35.768
Don't worry, I wasn't being reckless.
There's a plan.

00:37:39.059 --> 00:37:40.755
I'll bring more ammo next time.

00:37:52.465 --> 00:37:56.637
Aren't you curious
how I make the money?

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.066
You've never asked.

00:37:59.215 --> 00:38:00.434
No, I'm not.

00:38:06.642 --> 00:38:10.515
The more I know about you,
the worse off I become.

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:13.338
According to my experience.

00:38:47.768 --> 00:38:51.240
Show the money
and ID through the camera.

00:39:02.318 --> 00:39:04.750
Check the ceiling vent
in the bathroom.

00:39:45.817 --> 00:39:48.809
Put the money down
and take the goods.

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:54.849
Peek-a-boo.

00:41:03.621 --> 00:41:04.482
You're alone?

00:41:06.238 --> 00:41:08.380
Why aren't you answering?
Speak up.

00:41:11.271 --> 00:41:16.149
No, there are people outside.

00:41:17.154 --> 00:41:19.219
Bullshit.
There's nobody.

00:41:24.302 --> 00:41:25.184
Funny.

00:41:27.768 --> 00:41:30.849
To think someone like you
would sell such...

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:37.713
high-end product.

00:41:54.326 --> 00:41:59.129
I didn't join in on your plan
because I care about you.

00:41:59.903 --> 00:42:01.207
Nor because I forgave you.

00:42:04.262 --> 00:42:06.849
Wait, one question.

00:42:07.517 --> 00:42:10.557
Do you actually still paint?

00:42:31.726 --> 00:42:33.892
Take your mask off.

00:42:34.434 --> 00:42:38.848
How about this?
We won't lay a finger on you.

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:40.350
And in return,

00:42:40.462 --> 00:42:45.802
you stay quiet until we leave
with the drugs and the money.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.392
Sounds fair?

00:43:01.282 --> 00:43:06.582
How about 60 mil...
Or 50 mil?

00:43:09.652 --> 00:43:12.849
40...?

00:43:34.559 --> 00:43:35.933
Who's calling you?

00:43:35.975 --> 00:43:37.225
B♪♪CH

00:43:39.267 --> 00:43:41.806
Nobody. Bye.

00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:44.601
Hey, Kyung.

00:43:52.059 --> 00:43:55.864
Whatever you do,
keep our family out of it.

00:43:56.411 --> 00:43:58.267
I know you're trying
to fix your screw up,

00:43:58.309 --> 00:44:00.684
but it won't mean anything
if you fuck up more.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.768
Got it?

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:32.942
Hey, drink up!

00:44:49.266 --> 00:44:51.289
I know you're trying
to fix your screw up,

00:44:51.742 --> 00:44:54.142
but it won't mean anything
if you fuck up more.

00:44:54.985 --> 00:44:55.785
Got it?

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.849
MISSED CALL – ONE.

00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:11.517
KANG HWIRIM

00:45:15.849 --> 00:45:19.809
KANG HWIRIM

00:45:22.573 --> 00:45:23.260
Hello?

00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:27.184
Hey, I'm in a tight spot.
I need you.

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.436
Can you come right now?

00:45:31.225 --> 00:45:32.434
Now?

00:46:09.142 --> 00:46:10.309
Hey!

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.222
You bastards, stop right there!

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:15.017
Give me my money!

00:46:22.277 --> 00:46:23.777
Hey!

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:28.517
Bastards, stop right there!

00:46:33.392 --> 00:46:34.559
Hey!

00:46:45.517 --> 00:46:46.684
Give me my money!

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:53.726
Give me my money!

00:46:53.768 --> 00:46:55.892
Hand over my money, you bastards!

00:47:23.381 --> 00:47:26.259
What do you like
so much about Eunsoo?

00:47:41.849 --> 00:47:44.795
Eunsoo is strong in her heart.

00:47:45.052 --> 00:47:48.849
No matter how hard it gets,
no matter what happens,

00:47:49.771 --> 00:47:51.142
she never breaks down.

00:47:51.559 --> 00:47:52.768
Damn it.

00:49:33.849 --> 00:49:36.184
That crazy lady!

00:49:38.849 --> 00:49:40.849
You're fucked!

00:49:48.292 --> 00:49:50.726
Hey, push her over!
Push her, right now!

00:49:50.768 --> 00:49:52.476
Get her, damn it!

00:49:57.392 --> 00:49:58.726
Who the hell are you?

00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:01.059
Get out of the way!

00:50:03.892 --> 00:50:05.142
Who are you?

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:13.434
Who the hell is this guy?

00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:19.849
After her!

00:50:30.012 --> 00:50:31.476
Stop right there!

00:50:39.849 --> 00:50:41.017
Shit.

00:51:32.191 --> 00:51:33.316
Peek-a-boo!

00:51:42.174 --> 00:51:45.184
I finally found you.

00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:02.392
Get up. Hurry!

00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:13.021
That crazy lady!

00:52:14.642 --> 00:52:16.142
Come on, run faster!

00:52:16.184 --> 00:52:17.684
Hey!

00:52:17.726 --> 00:52:19.013
Don't they gas out?

00:53:28.642 --> 00:53:29.504
Hey!

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:31.465
Your mom finished her shift.

00:53:31.567 --> 00:53:33.504
- She's not home?
- No.

00:53:33.715 --> 00:53:36.231
- She got off work.
- Got it.

00:53:36.434 --> 00:53:38.059
Thank you.

00:54:03.959 --> 00:54:05.479
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.848
Why would you do
something like that?

00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:11.538
I told you no face-to-face deals,
especially by yourself!

00:54:12.268 --> 00:54:14.559
I had no choice, okay?

00:54:16.087 --> 00:54:18.044
You're the one who wanted results!

00:54:20.927 --> 00:54:23.053
Plus, things worked out in the end.

00:54:34.538 --> 00:54:39.037
Money is good,
but not enough to risk your life!

00:54:39.384 --> 00:54:42.849
They'll be looking for revenge.
Delete the chat and change your ID.

00:54:46.476 --> 00:54:50.341
But how did you
even know I was there?

00:54:50.411 --> 00:54:53.392
I put a tracker app
on the phone I gave you!

00:54:54.806 --> 00:54:55.806
Wow.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.969
Seriously? Unbelievable.

00:55:06.642 --> 00:55:07.849
By the way.

00:55:08.679 --> 00:55:10.387
Were you always good
on the scooter?

00:55:13.317 --> 00:55:15.768
I used to do delivery work, remember?

00:55:15.809 --> 00:55:18.496
I know that place inside out.
I know every alley.

00:55:18.527 --> 00:55:23.812
Is that why you met 'em there?
Guess you did prepare, huh?

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.848
Of course, I did!

00:55:24.849 --> 00:55:26.849
You drive me nuts!

00:55:27.164 --> 00:55:30.086
I can't tell if you're
reckless or thorough.

00:55:35.267 --> 00:55:36.849
Gosh...

00:55:38.456 --> 00:55:39.726
Let me see the money.

00:55:39.909 --> 00:55:42.892
Let me see.
We need to count.

00:56:33.392 --> 00:56:34.392
Get yourself checked.

00:56:34.997 --> 00:56:36.142
Good work today.

00:56:46.465 --> 00:56:47.631
What the hell?

00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:06.476
Is that the art tutor?

00:57:21.707 --> 00:57:23.136
It matches our product.

00:57:28.327 --> 00:57:29.350
And?

00:57:31.616 --> 00:57:35.584
We tried tracing the seller,
but the account's been deleted.

00:57:36.142 --> 00:57:39.455
Either he's cautious or
knows we're onto him.

00:57:39.463 --> 00:57:45.611
We're searching the area
where the delivery was sent from, but...

00:57:47.849 --> 00:57:48.850
Sorry, boss.

00:57:50.597 --> 00:57:54.013
He's not stupid enough
to send it from his neighborhood.

00:57:54.726 --> 00:57:56.099
Haengbok-dong...

00:57:56.326 --> 00:57:59.392
Start searching around
where Kim Bongnam was killed.

00:57:59.884 --> 00:58:02.298
They probably made a new ID.

00:58:02.626 --> 00:58:04.850
Raid all the Telegram drug dealers.

00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:10.286
Are we still in contact
with that money-grubber?

00:58:10.768 --> 00:58:11.849
Yes.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.934
I haven't heard from him
since the Minwoo case.

00:58:18.809 --> 00:58:22.642
Get him to figure out
who they are and how many.

00:58:23.312 --> 00:58:26.892
All we got for gouging
the money-grubber was Minwoo.

00:58:27.031 --> 00:58:29.476
We need more to get our money’s worth.

00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:32.559
Yes, boss.

00:58:38.363 --> 00:58:40.059
Clean that up before you go.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.309
Sure.

01:00:47.849 --> 01:00:49.476
I'm back.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:54.476
Mom?

01:02:16.681 --> 01:02:18.281
I want everything I tried on.

01:02:18.757 --> 01:02:19.849
- All of it?
- Yes.

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.517
Please wait a minute.

01:02:22.601 --> 01:02:24.849
- Ta-da!
- Enjoy.

01:02:27.849 --> 01:02:28.849
Help yourself.

01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:39.768
This is our best-seller,
known for sleeping aid.

01:02:39.809 --> 01:02:42.225
It's hugely popular overseas.

01:02:42.849 --> 01:02:44.726
I think your daughter loves it.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.017
- My shoulders and neck feel nice.
- Really?

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:49.849
- Try lying down too.
- Give it a try.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.059
- How is it? Comfortable?
- Yes!

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.809
Wow, this feels great.

01:02:57.197 --> 01:03:00.100
Mom, don't fall asleep here.

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.219
- Let's get this one.
- Yeah, it's really good.

01:03:04.227 --> 01:03:05.559
Yeah, it's nice.

01:03:05.601 --> 01:03:08.768

What brings her here?

01:03:45.517 --> 01:03:47.564
Today is the deadline
for the fees.

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:49.118
I got mine right here.

01:03:50.642 --> 01:03:52.848
Oh, I heard Hyeseon's brush
got stolen in the art room.

01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:55.142
I guess the art room
isn't safe anymore.

01:03:55.184 --> 01:03:56.106
Exactly.

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:58.517
- Did they catch the thief?
- Not yet.

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.642
- They haven't?
- No.

01:04:01.225 --> 01:04:03.278
Hey, is that a new phone?

01:04:03.341 --> 01:04:05.392
Way to go, Sua.
Congrats.

01:04:05.622 --> 01:04:07.973
What happened?
Did your family hit the lottery?

01:04:09.517 --> 01:04:10.657
What's your point?

01:04:10.665 --> 01:04:13.962
Why so serious?
I'm just saying.

01:04:27.809 --> 01:04:30.434
What happened?
Did your family hit the lottery?

01:05:15.642 --> 01:05:17.235
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Huh?

01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:18.977
Your favorite bulgogi.

01:05:19.642 --> 01:05:20.849
I'll make it quickly.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:32.642
Excuse me!

01:05:33.509 --> 01:05:35.324
- Who's that?
- I'll get it.

01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:38.017
Is anyone home?

01:05:54.142 --> 01:05:55.267
Hi.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.396
Is your mother home?

01:06:47.517 --> 01:06:50.392
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:54.156
Do you know anyone called James?

01:06:54.559 --> 01:06:56.023
Looks similar, right?

01:06:56.933 --> 01:06:58.225
Where is it?

01:06:58.941 --> 01:07:00.601
The man the police are after...

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:04.667
James is the bad guy,
and not you, right?

01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:06.386
Not much more to go.

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:08.892
You're saying we need to promote?

01:07:08.933 --> 01:07:10.184
A buzz.

01:07:10.428 --> 01:07:13.085
What did you do with the art tutor?

01:07:13.147 --> 01:07:15.303
I saw you getting out of his car.

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:20.849
Desperate people are the scariest
and the most ruthless.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.726
I want to kill them all.

01:07:24.768 --> 01:07:26.971
Because that's the ultimate revenge.
